That is our village down to the ground. You could not persuade one
of the aborigines that there is any place in England or outside it of
greater importance than Thurswell, because there is no place of greater
importance to the Thurswellian. An aged inhabitant was taken by his
son to see the coronation procession, and when he was asked what it was
like, replied, after a suitable pause, that it ran Thurs-well's Day
very hard--Thurswell's Day is the name given to the First Sunday after
Trinity, when the Free Foresters and Ancient Shepherds march to church
in sashes, with a band made up of a fife, three flutes, a drum, a
concertina, and a melodion.

"Ay, neighbours, it ran Thurswell's Day hard," he affirmed, and did not
flinch from his statement in spite of the incredulous murmur that arose
from the bench nearest the door, which was immediately suppressed by the
landlord, who was apprehensive of a riot.

Thurswell is a village of antiquity. Its name occurs in _Domesday
Book_, where you may look in vain for any mention of Brindlington, that
mushroom town of 60.000 inhabitants, which is nine miles to the north,
or even of Broadminster, the Cathedral town, which is seven miles to the
west. "Broadminster is where the Dean lives," I was told by the landlord
of the Wheatsheaf at Thurswell when I was making inquiries about the
district, "and Brindlington is where the brewery is; but my father got
his ale at Pipstone, and I get mine there too, though it's a blow to
Brindlington, for in harvest the best part of a cask goes within a
week."

There are several other villages within a mile or so of Thurswell, and
the inhabitants of some are infatuated enough to believe that they
are on a social, as well as a commercial, level with the people of
Thurswell. This singular hallucination caused a good deal of friction on
all sides in years gone by, and _the rapprochement_ that was eventually
brought about between Thurswell and its neighbours by the thoughtfulness
of a Rector, who preached a sermon on the vision of St. Peter and
enjoined upon his hearers to remember that even though people have not
been born in Thurswell they are still God's creatures, was a purely
sentimental one, and did not last.

Some years ago an article appeared in the _Topographical Gazette_
from the pen of an eminent archaeologist affirming that Thurswell must
originally have been Thor's Well, so that the place dated back to
the time of the worship of the Scandinavian god Thor; but while
this evidence of its antiquity was received by some of us with
enthusiasm--having been a resident in the village for a whole year I was
naturally an ardent Thurswellian--it was, when reproduced in the _East
Nethershire Weekly_, generally regarded as the invention of some
one anxious to give the enemies of the village some ground for their
animosity toward it. For the suggestion that it had a heathen origin was
not one, it was felt, to which its people could tamely submit. There was
some talk of a public meeting to protest against the conclusions come to
by the archaeologist, and the Rector was considered in some quarters to
be but a half-hearted champion of the Faith when he refused to lend the
schoolhouse--sixty people could be crowded into it--for this purpose,
his argument that the more heathen Thurswell had been in the past, the
more marked should be its display of the Christian virtue of charity in
the present, being criticised as savouring of Jesuitry. For months the
matter was the leading topic of the neighbourhood, and the Hearts of Oak
Habitation of the Ancient Shepherds drew up a resolution protesting in
this connection against "archaeology and every form of idolatry." It was
the misprint in the _Gazette_ that changed "Hearts of Oak" into "Heads
of Oak" in publishing the proceedings that quenched the violence of the
discussion, and now it is considered bad taste to refer to it at all.




II.--THE CENTENARIANS

More recently still another busybody endeavoured to deprive the village
of the reputation which it had long enjoyed as the centre of English
longevity. Now it would be impossible for any one to study the dates
on the tombstones in the churchyard without noticing how great was the
number of centenarians who died within the first fifty years of the
nineteenth century in the parish of Thurswell. There were apparently
eighteen men and fourteen women interred after passing their hundredth
year; indeed, one woman was recorded to have reached her hundred and
twenty-seventh year, which is a good age for a woman. The people were
naturally very proud of the constant references made in print to their
longevity; but one day there came down to the village a member of the
Statistical Society, and after busying himself among the musty parish
registers for a month, he announced his discovery that in every case but
one the date of the birth of the alleged centenarians was the date of
the birth of their parents. The investigator had noticed that all the
alleged centenarians had "departed this life" during the rectorship of
the Rev. Thomas Ticehurst, and centenarianism had always been his
fad. He had preached sermon after sermon on Methuselah and other
distinguished multi-centenarians, and he spent his time travelling about
the country in search of evidence in confirmation of the theory that
Methuselah, though somewhat beyond the average in respect of age, might
yet have been exceeded on his own ground by many people living in the
country districts of England. Nothing was easier, the investigator tried
to show, than for a clergyman in charge of the registers, who had such
a hobby, to assume, when any very old man or woman died in his parish,
that he or she actually was twenty years or so older; and as the
Christian names were nearly always hereditary, in nine cases out of
ten he accepted the registry of the birth of the father as that of the
lately deceased man, and the date of the birth of the mother in regard
to the aged woman, the result being a series of the most interesting
inscriptions.

I must confess that I myself felt that I had a personal grievance
against this busybody statistician. There is nothing so comforting to
the middle-aged as a stroll through a cemetery of centenarians; and I
had the most uncharitable feelings against the person who could make
such an attempt to deprive me of the pleasant hope of living another
sixty or seventy years.

But while we were still talking about the danger of permitting strangers
to have access to the registers, I was told one morning that a man who
had once been the gardener at the place which I had just acquired
would like to see me. Now, I had had already some traffic with the
superannuated gardener of my predecessor, and so I was now surprised to
find myself face to face with quite a different person.

"You were not the gardener here," I said. "I saw him; his name is
Craggs, and he still lives in the hollow."

"Oh ay, Jonas Craggs--young Joe, we called him; I knew his father,"
replied my visitor. "He was only here a matter of six-and-thirty years.
I was superann'ated to make way for him. Young-Joe, we called him, and I
was curious to see how things had come on in the garden of late."

"You were superannuated thirty-six years ago," said I. "What age are you
now?"

"I'm ninety-eight, sir," he replied with a smirk.

I showed him round the garden. He said he could see that the things he
had planted had grown summut; and I walked through the churchyard the
next Sunday with the greatest complacency.

When I told the Rector that my experience of this grand old gardener
tended to make me take the side of Thurswell and the neighbourhood
against scientific investigation in regard to longevity, he assured
me that if I paid a visit to a certain elderly lady who lived with a
middle-aged granddaughter in a cottage on the road to Cransdown I should
find ample confirmation of the faith for which I had a leaning. The
lady's name was, he said, Martha Trendall, and she really was, he
thought, a genuine centenarian, for she had a vivid recollection of
events which had happened quite ninety years ago; and, unlike most
reputed centenarians, she remembered many details of the historical
incidents that had taken place in her young days; she was a most
intelligent person altogether, and had evidently been at one time a
great reader, though latterly her eyesight had shown signs of failing.

I made up my mind to pay a visit to this Mrs. Trendall, and thought that
perhaps I might get material for a letter to the _Times_ that should not
leave the scientific investigator a leg to stand on. A month, however,
elapsed before I carried out my intention, though the Rector thought
this was not a case for procrastination: when a lady is anything over a
hundred her hold upon life shows a tendency to relax, he said, for even
the most notorious centenarians cannot be expected to live for ever. But
when I managed to make my call I must confess that I was amply repaid
for the time I spent in the company of Mrs. Trendall.

I found her sitting in her chair in what is called the chimney corner
when it exists in its original condition in a cottage, but is termed the
"ingle nook" in those red brick imitation cottages which are being flung
about the country by those architects who concern themselves in the
development of estates. I saw at once that such a figure would be out of
place anywhere except in the chimney corner of a cottage kitchen, with
immovable windows, but a "practicable" iron crane for the swinging
of pots over the hearth fire. The atmosphere--thanks to the immobile
casements--was also all that it should be: it was congenially
centenarian, I perceived in a moment. It had a pleasant pungency of old
bacon, but though I looked about for a genuine flitch maturing in
the smoke, I failed to see one--still, the nail on which it should be
hanging was there all right.

The old woman was quite alert. There was nothing of the wheezy gammer
about her. Only one ear was slightly deaf, she told me when I had been
introduced by her granddaughter--a woman certainly over fifty. She
smiled referring to her one infirmity, and when she smiled the parchment
of her face became like the surface of the most ancient palimpsest: it
was seamed by a thousand of the finest lines, and made me feel that
I was looking at an original etching by Rembrandt or Albert Dürer--a
"trial proof," not evenly bitten in places; and the cap she wore added
to the illusion.

She was, I could see, what might be called a professional centenarian,
and so might retain some of those prejudices which existed long ago
against "talking shop" and therefore I refrained from referring in any
way to her age: I felt sure that when the right moment came she would
give me an opening, and I found that I had not misjudged her. I
had scarcely told her how greatly we all liked our house before she
gratified me by a reminiscence of the antepenultimate owner: he had
died, I happen to know, thirty-eight years ago, and Mrs. Trendall
remembered the morning he first rode his black horse to hounds--that was
the year before he married, and his son was now a major-general. "A
long time ago," I remarked, and she smiled the patronising smile of the
professional at the feeble effort of an incompetent amateur. "Long
ago? Oh no; only a bit over sixty years--maybe seventy." The difference
between sixty and seventy years ago was in her eyes not worth taking any
account of. Her treatment of this reminiscence gave me warning of what
she could do when she had her second wind and got into her stride.

"You must have a great memory, Mrs. Trendall," I remarked. "Was there
much stir in this neighbourhood when Queen Victoria got married? I heard
something about a big bonfire on Earl's Beacon."

"'Twere no more'n a lucifer match in compare with the flare up after
Waterloo," was her complacent reply; and I felt as if I had just had an
audacious pawn taken by my opponent's Queen. "Ay, Thurswell lost three
fine youngsters at Waterloo. There was Amos Scovell, him with the red
hair."

"The one they used to call Carrots?" I suggested.

She brightened up.

"The very same--Carrots they called him sure enough," she said, nodding.
"But you couldn't have knowed'un; you're no more'n a stripling as yet.
Doan't you list to all that you hear from them that calls theirselves
ancient old venerables; there's not a one of'un that's truthfully
old--I'm the only one; take my word for it, sir."

I gave her to understand (I hope) by my confidential smile and shake
of the head that I was aware of the many fraudulent claims to longevity
advanced by some of our friends about Thurswell.

"Age? Age is an empty thing without a memory," I remarked. "But what a
memory you have, Mrs. Trendall! I shouldn't wonder if you recollected
the news of Nelson's victory at Trafalgar arriving in England--oh no:
that was too long ago even for you."

She bridled up in a moment.

"Too long ago for me?--too long, quotha! Don't I mind it as if it
happened no earlier'n last week? It were before I married my first. It
were my father that came a-bustling hasty like and wi' a face rosy
wi' beer and hurry, and says he, 'Nelson has broke the Frenchies on
us--broke them noble, and we may look for'un coming home any day
now,' says he; and there wasn't a sober man in the five parishes that
night--no, not a one. Ay, those was times!"

"Surely--surely," I acquiesced. "But now that you can look back on them
quite calmly in the afternoon of your life, would you really say that
they were more lively times than when the Duke of Marlborough was doing
his fighting for us? You've heard your mother speak of Marlborough, I'm
sure."

"My mother--speak! Why, I see'un for myself wi' these very eyes when he
come home from the wars--a nice, well-set-up gentleman, if so be that I
know what'tis to be a gentleman. It was when he come to pay his respex
to Squire Longden at Old Deane--the squire that married thrice, as
they said, the first for love, the second for lucre, and the third
for--for--now was it for liquor or learning?--Well, 'twere one of the
two. Ay, sir, those was the times--before there was any talk about
Prince Albert and the Christian Palace in London."

"I should rather think so. And if you are old enough to remember seeing
the great Duke of Marlborough, I am sure that you may remember seeing
Oliver Cromwell when he came through Thurswell with his army?"

"Oliver Cromwell? You've spoke the truth, sir. I see'un once--on'y once,
to be exact. I mind'un well.'Twere in the mid o' hay harvest, and father
come up to us in a mortial great haste, and says he, 'Martha lass,
throw down that rake and I'll show you the greatest sight o' your
life--Cromwell hisself on a mighty skewbald.' And, sure enough, there he
was a-galloping at the head of a fine army o' men, with guns a-rumbling
and the bugles blowing--grand as a circus--ay, Batty's Circus with all
the fun about Jump Jim Crow and Billy Barlow and the rest. Oh, I saw'un
sure."

"And Queen Elizabeth--I wonder if you ever chanced to see her?"

"Never, sir--never! 'Twere always the sorrow o' my life that the day
she passed through Ticebourne, where I was living with my grand-aunt
Martha--her that I was named after--I had been sent with a basket o'
three dozen eggs--one dozen of'em turkeys--to the big house, and her
ladyship not being at home I had to wait the best part of a whole hour,
and by the time I got back the Queen had driven away, so I missed
the chance o' my life; for being since my early years noteworthy for
speaking the truth to a hairs-breadth, I couldn't bring myself to say
that I had seen a royal person when I hadn't. But what I can say is that
I on'y missed seeing of her by twenty minutes, more or less."

I began to feel that I might be overwhelmed if I were borne much farther
in the current of the pellucid stream of Mrs. Trendall's veracity; so I
rose and thanked the good woman for her courtesy, and expressed the hope
that the efforts she had made on my behalf to be rigidly accurate had
not fatigued her.

She assured me that all she had said was nothing to what she could say
if I had a mind to listen to her.

When I acknowledged to the Rector that the memory of Martha had
surpassed my most sanguine hopes, he was greatly delighted. I thought it
well, however, to neglect the opportunity he gave me of going into the
details of her interesting recollections. Before we dropped the subject,
he said what a pity it was that an historian of the nineteenth century
could not avail himself of the services of Martha to keep him straight
on some points that might be pronounced of a contentious nature.

Not many days after my interesting interview with Martha, the
professional centenarian, the decease of an unobtrusive amateur was
notified to me. It came about through the temporary disorganisation of
our bread service, which I learned was due to the sudden death of the
baker's mother. Entering his shop a week or two later, I ventured to say
a word of conventional condolence to him, and this was responded to
by him with a mournful volubility that made me feel as if I had just
attended a funeral oration, or an inefficient reading of "In Memoriam."
It was a terrible blow to him, he said--a cruel blow; and he went on to
suggest that it was such an apparently gratuitous stroke that it made
even the most orthodox man doubt the existence of mercy in the Hand that
had inflicted it.

"No doubt, no doubt," I acquiesced. "But, after all, we must all die
some day, Martin, and your good mother could scarcely be said to have
been cut off long before she had reached the allotted span. You know you
can hardly call yourself a young man still, Martin."

He shook his head as if to hint that he had heard this sort of thing
before. I think it very probable that he had: I know that I had, more
than once. But I thought that there was no occasion for him to suggest
so much, so I boldly asked him what age his mother had reached.

He shook his head, not laterally this time, but longitudinally, and
distributing the flies more evenly over a plate of jam tarts with a
mournful whisk of his feather duster, he replied--

"She was a hundred and four last February, sir."

I turned right about and left him alone with his irreparable grief.




III. THE POINT OF VIEW

On the subject of age, I may say that it has always seemed to me that
it is the aim of most people to appear as young as possible--and perhaps
even more so--for as long as possible--and perhaps even longer; but
then it seems gradually to dawn upon them that there may be as much
distinction attached to age as to youth, and those who have been trying
to pass themselves off as much younger than they really are turn their
attention in the other direction and endeavour to make themselves out to
be much older than the number of their years. It is, of course, chiefly
in the cottages that the real veterans are to be found--old men and
women who take a proper pride in having reached a great if somewhat
indefinite age, and in holding in contempt the efforts of a neighbour to
rival them in this way. One of the peculiarities of these good folk is
to become hilarious over the news of the death of some contemporary.
I have seen ancient men chuckle at the notion of their having survived
some neighbour who, they averred with great emphasis, was much their
junior. The idea seems to strike them as being highly humorous. And so
perhaps it may be, humour being so highly dependent upon the standpoint
from which it is viewed.

In the cottages the conversation frequently turns upon the probability
of an aged inmate being gathered unto his fathers before next harvest
or, if in autumn, before the first snow, and the utmost frankness
characterises the remarks made on this subject in the presence of
the person who might be supposed to be the most interested in the
discussion, though, as a matter of fact, he is as little interested in
it as the Tichborne claimant acknowledged he was in his trial after it
had passed its fortieth day. I was fortunate enough to reach the shelter
of a farm cottage before a great storm a few years ago, and on a truckle
bed in the warm side of the living room of the family there lay an old
man, who nodded to me and quavered out a "good marn." I asked the woman,
who was peeling potatoes sitting on a stool, if he was her father or her
husband's father.

"He's Grandpaw Beck; but don't you take any heed o' him, sir, he's
dying," she replied, with the utmost cheerfulness. "Doctor's bin here
yestereve, and says he'll be laid out afore a week. But we've everything
handylike and ready for'un."

[Illustration: 0033]

She pointed to a chair on which some white garments were neatly laid. "I
run the iron o'er'em afore settin' to the bit o' dinner," she explained.

I glanced at the old man. He nodded his approval of her good
housekeeping. He clearly thought that procrastination should be
discountenanced.

The flashes of lightning and the peals of thunder seemed to me to be by
no means extravagant accompaniments to this grim scene (as it appeared
in my eyes). I have certainly known far less impressive scenes on
the stage thought worthy of the illumination of lightning and the
punctuation of thunder claps.

This familiar treatment of the subject of the coming of the grim figure
with the scythe prevails in every direction. A friend of mine had a like
experience in a cottage in another part of the country. The man of the
house--he was a farm labourer--was about to emigrate to Canada, and was
anxious to get as good a price as possible for some pieces of old china
in his possession, and my friend had called to see them by invitation.
He was brought into a bedroom where the plates were to be seen on a
dresser; and by way of making conversation on entering the room, he
asked the man when he thought of leaving England.

"Oh, very shortly now," he replied. "Just as soon as feyther there dies"
(jerking his head in the direction of a bed), "and he's far gone--he's
dying fast--Doctor Jaffray gives us great hope that a week'll
finish'un."

He then went on to talk about the china, explaining that three of the
pieces had been brought by his grandmother from the Manor House, where
she had been still-room maid for twenty-six years.

"Twenty-eight years--twenty-eight years, Amos," came a correcting
falsetto from the bed.

"You know nowt o' the matter," cried the son. "This is no business o'
yours. We doan't want none o' your jaw. Go on wi' your dying."




CHAPTER TWO.--OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE




I.--THE GENERAL

ON A VERY DIFFERENT PLANE OF INterest I regard my experience of two
delightful old people whom I found living, the one a mile or two on
the Brindlington side of Thurswell, the other on the Broadminster side,
"where the Dean lives." The former is an old general who once
commanded a regiment of Sikhs and spent fifty years in India. He is now
eighty-three years of age, and has two sons with the rank of colonel, a
grandson who is a captain of Sappers, and two who are lieutenants in
the navy. The old man has nothing of the bristling retired general about
him--not even the liver. He is of a gentle, genial nature, not very
anxious to hear the latest news, and not at all eager to make his
visitors acquainted with his experiences in India or his views as to the
exact degree of decadence reached by "the sarvice." He speaks in a low
and an almost apologetic tone, and is interested in old Oriental china
and tortoiseshell tea-caddies. One could never believe that this was
the man whose sobriquet of Shire-i-Iran (Lion of Persia) was once a
household word along the turbulent northwest frontier, or that he had
been the most brilliant exponent of all the dash which one associates
with the cavalry leader. His reputation on that long frontier was that
of an Oriental equivalent of the Wild Huntsman of the German ballad.
People had visions of him galloping by night at the head of his splendid
Sikhs to cut off the latest fanatical insurrectionary from his supports,
and then sweep him and his marauders off the face of the earth.
Certainly no cavalry leader ever handled his men with that daring
which he displayed--a daring that would have deserved to be called
recklessness had it once failed.... And there he sat at dinner, talking
in his low voice about the fluted rim of one of his tea-caddies, and
explaining how it was quite possible to repair the silver stringing that
beautified the top. Once I fancied I overheard him telling the person
who sat by him at dinner about the native regiments--I felt sure that
I heard the word "Sepoy," and I became alert. Alas! the word that I had
caught was only "tea-poy"--he was telling how he had got a finely cut
glass for a deficient caddie out of an old nineteenth-century mahogany
tea-poy. That was the nearest approach he made to the days of his
greatness.

But I noticed with satisfaction that he partook of every dish that was
offered to him--down to the marmalade pudding. At dessert he glanced
down the table and said that he thought he would have an apple. "No,
dear," said his daughter, gently but firmly removing the dish beyond his
reach. "You know that you are not allowed to touch apples."

"Why, what harm will an apple do me--just one--only one apple?" he
inquired, and there were tears in his voice--it had become a tremulous
pipe, the tone of a child whose treat had been unjustly curtailed. "No,
dear, not even one. It is for your own good: you should have an apple if
it agreed with you; but it doesn't."

"I want an apple--I can't see what harm an apple would do me," he cried
again. But his daughter was firm. It was very pathetic to witness
the scene. The Lion of Persia becoming plaintive at being denied a
rosy-cheeked apple. The man who, with a force of only six hundred sabres
behind him, had ridden up to Mir Ali Singh with the three thousand
rebels supporting him, and demanded his sword, and got it, not being
able to get his apple when he had asked for it nicely, seemed to me to
be a most pathetic figure. I pleaded for him as one pleads for a child
in the nursery: he had been a good boy and had eaten all that had been
set before him quite nicely--why might he not have an apple to make him
happy?

But the daughter was inexorable. She told me that I did not know her
father, while she did. An apple would be poison to him; and so the old
hero was left complaining, with an occasional falsetto note, upon the
restrictions of his commissariat. I am pretty sure that there was no
falsetto note in any of his complaints in regard to commissariat forty
years ago.

He was a noble old warrior, however, for when his daughter had, with the
rest of the ladies, left us after dinner, he never put out a hand to
the apple dish, though there was no man at the table who would have
interfered with him had he done so; the Newtown Pippins remained
blushing, but not on account of any disloyalty on his part to the duty
he owed to the daughter who had his welfare at heart.




II.--THE DEAR OLD LADY

The aged lady who lives in a lovely old moated house a few miles out of
Thurswell is one of the youngest people I ever met. She is the mother
of two distinguished sons and the grandmother of a peeress. She takes an
interest in everything that is going on in various parts of the world,
and even points out the mistakes made by the leader-writers in the
London papers--some of the mistakes. But she does so quite cheerfully
and without any animus. She still sketches _en plein air_, and in her
drawings there is no suggestion of the drawing-master of the early
Victorians. Any elderly person who could hold a pencil and whose moral
character could bear a strict investigation was accounted competent to
teach drawing in those days; for drawing in those days meant nothing
beyond making a fair copy of a lithograph of a cottage in a wood with
a ladder leaning against a gable and a child sitting on a fence--a
possible successful statesman in the future--with a dog below him. She
never was so taught, she told me: she had always held out against the
restrictions of the schoolroom of her young days, and had never played
either the "Maiden's Prayer" or the "Battle of Prague." Thalberg's
variations on "Home Sweet Home" she had been compelled to learn. No
young lady in that era of young ladies could avoid acquiring at least
the skeleton of Thalberg's masterpiece: and I was glad that this
particular old lady, who had once been a young lady, had mastered it;
for it enabled her to give me the most delightful parody upon it that
could be imagined.

Only once did I hear her speak with bitterness in referring to any one;
but when she began upon this occasion, she spoke not only bitterly, but
wrathfully--contemptuously as well. She was referring to the Emperor
Napoleon III. in his relations with the unhappy Maximilian of Mexico.
She had known the latter intimately. My own impression is that she had
been in love with him--and tears were in her eyes when she talked of how
he had been betrayed by the man whom she called a contemptible little
cad. Sedan represented, in her way of thinking, the cordial agreement
with her views by the Powers above. To hear her talk of those tragedies
of more than forty years ago, as if they were the incidents of the day
before yesterday, was inspiriting. I never inquired what was her age,
but one afternoon when I called upon her I found that a birthday party
was going on--a double party; for it was her birthday as well as
her youngest grandchild's. Two fully iced cakes, with pink and white
complexions, were being illuminated in the customary way, and each had
been made a candelabrum of eight tapers. When I ventured to suggest
that there must be an error in computation in some direction, it was
the younger of the beneficiaries who explained to me that about seventy
years or so ago Granny had become too old to allow of her birthday cake
holding the full amount of the candles to which she was entitled, so it
had been agreed that she should have only one candle for every ten years
of her life. The little girl confided in me that she thought it was
rather a shame to cheat poor Granny out of her rights, but of course
there was no help for it: any one could see that no cake could be made
large enough to accommodate, without undue crowding, eighty-one candles.

I looked at the sweet old Granny, and thought, for some reason or
other, of the night of the first January of the century when I had stood
listening to the tolling of the eighty-one strokes of the church bell in
Devonshire, when every belfry in the kingdom announced the age of the
good Queen who had gone to her rest. I wondered...

This dear lady of the eight-candle birthday cake--of which, by the bye,
she partook heartily and apparently without the least misgiving--had
been married at the age of seventeen, and this, she thought, was exactly
the right age for a girl to marry, not, as might be supposed, because
it admitted of her period of repentance being so much the longer, but
simply because she considered grandchildren so interesting. She was not
inclined to be tolerant over the prudent marriages of the present day,
when no girl is unreasonable enough to expect a proposal before she
is twenty-five, or from a man who is less than thirty-five. It almost
brought me back to Shakespeare's England to hear her express such
opinions. That stately old lady, Juliet's mother, as she appears in
every modern production of the play, was made by the author to be
something between twenty-six and twenty-seven, her daughter being some
months under fourteen, but certainly forward for her age. We used to be
informed by sage critics of this drama "of utter love defeated utterly"
that Shakespeare made Juliet so young because it was the custom in
Italy, where girls developed into womanhood at a much earlier age than
in England, for a girl to marry at Juliet's time of life. It so happens,
however, that early marriage was the custom in England and not in Italy
in the sixteenth century. When a girl was twelve her parents looked
about for a promising husband for her, and usually found one when she
was thirteen.

Only a few months ago I came upon an unpublished letter, written in the
beautiful Gothic hand of Queen Elizabeth, in response to the inquiry of
an ambassador respecting a wife for an amiable young prince. The Queen
suggested two names of highly eligible young women, and mentioned that
one of them was twelve and the other thirteen!

The most flagrant example of unbridled centenarianism which I have yet
come across in the course of my investigations in the neighbourhood of
Thurswell was that of a lady who had won quite a literary aureole for
her silver hair owing to the accident of her being actually the original
"Cousin Amy" of Tennyson's "Locksley Hall." For years she had worn this
honourable distinction, and, so far as I could gather, her title to it
had never been disputed. Even in the Cathedral Close of Broadminster the
tradition had been accepted, and she had been pointed out to strangers,
who doubtless looked at her with interest, saying, "Not really!" or "How
perfectly sweet!"

I ventured to ask the prebendary who had told me that the poet had been
in love with her and consequently "greatly cut up" when she married some
one else--as might be inferred from some passages in the poem--what
was the present age of the lady, and he assured me that she was
seventy-four. She did not look it, but she really was seventy-four. I
had not the heart to point out that twenty-three years had elapsed since
Tennyson published his sequel--"Sixty Years After"--to his "Locksley
Hall," so that this "Cousin Amy" must be at least a centenarian if she
had not died, as described in the sequel, between eighty and ninety
years ago. She was, however, a nice old lady and her name was really
Amy, and she had known Alfred Tennyson when she had been very young and
he a middle-aged gentleman whom it was a great privilege to know.

THURSWELL IS UNDOUBTEDLY AN IDeal English village situated in the
midst of an agricultural county, and far away from the unhealthy and
demoralising influences of trade. It prides itself on being "select"--so
does every other English village, even when it lies deep embowered among
the striking scenery of a coal-mining district. But Thurswell is really
"select." A strange family may come to one of the best houses--one
of the four or five that have entrance gates with lodges and carriage
drives--and yet remain absolutely ignored by the older residents. Of
course the shopkeepers pay the newcomers some little attention, and the
ladies who collect for the various charities and the various churches
are quite polite in making early calls; but the question of calling
formally and leaving cards simply because the people are newcomers,
requires to be thoroughly threshed out before it is followed by any
active movement on the part of the senior residents. It has been
called unsocial on this account; but everybody in the world--at least,
everybody in Thurswell--knows that to be called unsocial is only another
way of being called select The Rector must pronounce an opinion on the
strangers, and--more important still--the Rector's wife. The example of
the Barnaby-Granges, who have lived for centuries at the Moated Manor
House, must be observed for what it is worth. It is understood that
people like the Barnaby-Granges may call upon strangers out of a sense
of duty; but every one knows how far astray from the path trod by the
"select" a sense of duty may lead one, so that the fact of the Manor
House people having called upon the newcomer is not invariably regarded
as conferring upon the latter the privilege of a passport to the most
representative Society at Thurswell. The strangers must wait until Mrs.
Lingard and Miss Mercer have decided whether they are to be called on
or ignored. Mrs. Lingard is the widow of a captain of Sappers, and Miss
Mercer is the middle-aged daughter of a previous rector, and for years
these ladies have assumed the right of veto in respect of the question
of calling upon newcomers. Within the past year, however, this question,
it should be mentioned, has developed certain complications, owing to
the strained relations existing between the two ladies. Previously they
formed a sort of vigilance committee to determine what should be done,
but since the breaking off of diplomatic relations between them the poor
people who had previously looked to them jointly for guidance are
now compelled to consult them severally as to the course they mean to
pursue, and all this takes time, and the loss of time in the etiquette
of first calls may be construed into actual rudeness by sensitive
people.

That is how we stand at present; and although many well-meaning
persons--not invariably belonging to clerical circles--have endeavoured
to bring about a _rapprochement_ for the good of the whole community
between Mrs. Lingard and Miss Mercer, hitherto every effort of the kind
has failed.

When the particulars of the incident that brought about the friction
between the two ladies are known, it will easily be understood that
a restoration of the _status quo ante_ is not to be accomplished in a
moment.

It was all due to the exceptionally dry summer. People who retain
only the pleasantest recollections of that season of sunlight and balmy
breezes will probably find reason to modify their views respecting it
when they hear how it led to the shattering of an old friendship and,
incidentally, to the complication of the most important social question
that can come before such a community as is represented by Thurs-well.




II.--THE SHATTERING OF THE PILLARS

The facts of the matter are simple enough in their way. Each of the
ladies occupies a small house of her own, fully, and not semi-detached,
with a small patch of green in front and a small garden at the back;
but the combined needs of front and back are not considered sufficiently
great to take up all the time of a gardener working six days in the week
during the summer. There is enough work, however, to take up three days
of the six, with window-cleaning thrown in, in slack seasons. As the
conditions of labour are identical in the case of the gardens of both
ladies--only Miss Mercer throws in the washing of her pug to balance
Mrs. Lingard's window-cleaning--John Bingham, the jobbing gardener of
Thurswell, suggested several years ago that he should divide his time
between the two gardens, and this plan, to all appearances, worked very
satisfactorily in regard to every one concerned.

[Illustration: 0051]

Only John Bingham was aware of the trouble involved in keeping both
gardens on precisely the same level of "getting on"--only John Bingham
was aware of the difficulty of preventing either of the ladies from
seeing that anything in the garden of the other was "getting on" better
than the same thing in her own patch. It might have been fancied that
as they were in complete agreement respecting the necessity for a strict
censorship upon the visiting lists of the neighbourhood as regards
strangers, there could not possibly exist any rivalry between them on so
insignificant a matter as the growth of a petunia or the campanile of
a campanula; but John Bingham knew better. It had been his task year
by year to minimise to the one lady his success with the garden of
the other--to say a word of disparagement on Thursdays, Fridays, and
Saturdays of all that he had been praising on Mondays, Tuesdays, and
Wednesdays. But sometimes Nature is stronger even than her greatest
enemy, a jobbing gardener, and so it was that when Mrs. Lingard chanced
to pay a visit to Miss Mercer on a Thursday, she found the garden of the
latter, just recovering from the hand of John Bingham's attention on the
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, obviously superior in some respects to
her own, and John found his diplomatic resources quite unable to meet
with the demand for an explanation when she got home. It was in vain
that he tried to make her understand, what she certainly should have
known already from her experience of the ministrations of John--namely,
that not he, but the superior soil and aspect of Miss Mercer's
herbaceous border, should be regarded accountable for the marvellous
growths which had attracted her attention in the garden of her rival.
His Thursday, Friday, and Saturday patron declared herself far from
satisfied with such an explanation. Soil! Had she ever shown herself
to be close-fisted in the matter of soil? she inquired. And as for
aspect--had he not chosen the aspect of the herbaceous border at which
he was now working? No, she knew very well, she affirmed, that what
made a garden beautiful was loving care. She professed herself unable to
understand why John should lavish all his affection upon Miss Mercer's
border rather than upon her own; all that she could do was to judge by
results, and, viewed from this basis, it could not but be apparent
to every unprejudiced observer that he had been giving Miss Mercer's
borders such loving touches as he had never bestowed upon her own: the
flowers spoke for themselves.

John had heard of the Language of Flowers, but he had never mastered the
elements of their speech. As a matter of fact, he took no interest in
flowers or their habits. He had "dratted" them times without number for
their failure to do all that the illustrated catalogues declared they
would do, and now he found reason to drat those of Miss Mercer for
having done much more than he had meant them to do. It was with a view
to restore the balance of mediocrity between the gardens, which had been
through no fault of his, disturbed by a sudden outbreak of "Blushing
Brides" in Miss Mercer's parterre, that he gave some extra waterings
to Mrs. Lingard's verbinas, trusting to convince her that he was
a thoroughly disinterested operator in both the gardens--which was
certainly a fact. But in that arid summer the response of the verbinas
was but too rapid, and Miss Mercer, calling upon her friend (and rival),
was shown the bed with the same pride that she had displayed when
exhibiting her petunias.

She said nothing--the day was Saturday--but she perceived, with that
unerring intuition which in some persons almost takes the place of
genius, that petunias had been supplanted (literally) by verbinas in the
affections of John Bingham.

She spent the Sunday rehearsing an interview which she had arranged in
her mind to have with John Bingham when he should arrive the next day.

But Monday came, and John Bingham failed to arrive. She waited at the
back entrance to the garden until ten o'clock, but still he did not
appear. Then she sent a messenger to his cottage to inquire the cause
of his absence. Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday were her days for his
services, and never once had he failed her. She could not guess what was
the matter. She had always regarded him as a sober man and one for whom
Monday morning had no terrors. The mystery of his first failure was
rendered all the more unfathomable when the tweeny maid returned saying
that Mrs. Bingham had told her positive that John had gone out to work
as usual that same morning, and that Mrs. Bingham had taken it for
granted that he was in Miss Mercer's garden.

For a quarter of an hour Miss Mercer pondered over the whole incident,
and then she suddenly put on another hat, discarding the garden specimen
with which she had begun the day, and went down the road and round by
the Moated Manor House to where Mrs. Lingard's villa was situated, just
beyond the knoll of elms. The hall door was wide open to the morning
air, and through the glass door at the farther end of the hall she
distinctly saw Mrs. Lingard standing on the edge of one of the beds of
the garden with John Bingham kneeling at her feet.

And this on a Monday morning!

John Bingham had actually attended morning ser-vice in the church the
day before--Miss Mercer had seen him there--and yet on Monday he
had broken faith with her, and now, at ten-thirty, he was engaged in
planting out the contents of the capacious basket which Mrs. Lingard was
doling out to him.

And Mrs. Lingard was wearing her garden hat just as if the day was
Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, when she was entitled to his services.

And Mrs. Lingard had also been at church the previous day and had
repeated the responses in her ordinary tone of voice, and without
faltering, though beyond a doubt her heart had been full of this scheme
of suborning a faithful, if somewhat weak, servant from his allegiance
to the mistress who had an undisputed claim to his services the next
day!

Without a moment's hesitation Miss Mercer passed into the hall, opened
the glass door beyond, and stood beside the guilty pair before either
of them was aware of her presence. She saw that the man was planting
asters--the finest aster cuttings she had ever seen.

"John Bingham, are you aware that this is Monday morning?" she said in
an accusing voice, and so suddenly that a cry of surprise--it may have
been with guilt--came from Mrs. Lingard, and John Bingham let drop his
trowel and wiped his forehead.

"Good gracious, Lucy! Where did you drop from without warning?" cried
the lady in the garden hat.

"I am addressing John Bingham, madam," said Miss Mercer in icy tones.
"And once again I ask John Bingham what he means by being here when his
place should be in my garden."

"I can easily explain, my good woman," said Mrs. Lingard, lapsing, under
the "madam" of the other, into the tone of voice she had found effective
with the native servants in the West Indian island of St. Lucia when her
husband had been stationed there.

"I am not addressing you, madam," said Miss Mercer hotly: her glacial
period had passed and had given place to the volcanic--the
suppressed volcanic. "I wish to be informed why this man--this
traitor--this--this----"

"Don't be a greater fool than you are by nature, my good creature," said
Mrs. Lingard. "But I might have known that you could be disagreeable
over even such a trifle as my sending to John Bingham to assist me
for an hour in planting out the asters which were only delivered this
morning when they should have been here on Saturday. If I had not begged
him to come to my help for a couple of hours the lot would have been
spoiled. In justice to him I will say that he was very unwilling to
come."

"And what does that mean, pray?" asked Miss Mercer sneeringly.

"It means that he knew you better than I did," responded Mrs. Lingard.
"He has had more experience of your narrow-mindedness than I have had.
Now, go on with your work, John. Don't mind her."

But John did not go on with his work. He touched his forehead with the
drooping aster that he held rather limply, saying, in the direction of
Miss Mercer--"I can easy make up the extra however, ma'am--mortal easy,
in the evenin', and so I thought or I wouldn't be here now."

"There, let that satisfy you, make your mind easy; you'll not be
defrauded of the shilling for his two hours," said Mrs. Lingard.

"You will be good enough to dictate to your inferiors, if such exist,
madam; you need not dictate to me. You may keep your John Bingham now
that you have him; I have made other arrangements for the future of my
garden."

She turned with a mock courtesy. Mrs. Lingard also turned.

"Lucy Mercer, go back to your--your--your hen-run," she cried, pointing
dramatically to the place of exit. "Go on with your work, John Bingham.
Mrs. Hopewell will only be too glad to take on your Thursdays, Fridays,
and Saturdays. _She_ has a garden--_a garden_."

That is the true and circumstantial account of how Mrs. Lingard and Miss
Mercer ceased to be on speaking terms, and that is how it is that many
people are becoming more hopeful of the future of Thurswell as the
centre of a social neighbourhood. Each lady still arrogates to herself
the right of veto in respect of the claims of any strange family to be
visited on taking up their residence within reasonable visiting distance
of Thurswell; but the people who formerly had been ready to accept the
dictum of the two in such social matters are now beginning not only to
assert their own independence of action, but even to dictate to others
on all points on which they themselves had been dictated to--in no mild
way--by Mrs. Lingard and Miss Mercer. But a mistake that was recently
made by one of these immature dictators has done much to chasten their
longing to take up the responsibilities attached to such a position. She
had spoken with that definiteness which marks the amateur on the subject
of the visiting of a certain Mrs. Judson Hyphen Marks who had taken
Higham Lodge for a year, and accordingly quite a number of people left
cards upon her. But suddenly the name of Judson Hyphen Marks appeared
rather prominently in the columns devoted to the Law Court proceedings
in the daily papers, and some curious information respecting the
_ménage_ of the Judson Hyphen Marks was brought under the notice of the
people of Thurswell and, indeed, of England generally; and those who had
left cards upon them consulted together as to whether it was possible or
not for them to ask for their cards to be returned to them.

The general opinion that prevailed after several long discussions on
this question was that no social machinery existed by which so desirable
an object might be effected, and no move was made in that direction; but
ever afterward the dictation of the feeble amateur who thought to take
the social reins out of the hands of Mrs. Lingard and Miss Mercer
when it was found that they were pulling them in opposite directions,
threatening to upset the social apple-cart, was received for what it was
worth, not for what it claimed to be worth.




III.--FLOWERS AND FRIENDSHIPS

The instance just recorded of horticulture playing a prominent part in
the breaking up of friendships is by no means unique. When one comes
to think of it, one cannot be surprised that as the earliest serious
quarrel recorded in the history of the world was over a purely
horticultural question--namely, whether or not the qualities of
beneficent nutrition attributed to a certain fruit had been accurately
analysed--there should be many differences of opinion among the best of
friends on the same subject.

It was my old gardener--not-the oldest of all, but the second
oldest--who told me how it was that the annual prize given by the Moated
Manor House people for the best floral display of the cottage order was
very nearly withdrawn for ever, owing to the bad blood that was made by
the award, no matter in what direction it was made. It seemed that the
prize-winner invariably found himself compelled to accept the challenge
to fight of all the disappointed aspirants to the prize, and before
nightfall there was a general distribution of black eyes and front
teeth; in some cases both got inextricably mixed up, and this was no
pleasure to anybody, my informant assured me, and the wives of the men
who were keen to compete for the prize discouraged them from it,
with the warning that if they continued to spend their time over the
cultivation of the blooms they might some day actually find themselves
awarded the prize. That warning, founded as it was upon sound sense and
reason, was beginning to produce its effects upon the better class of
flower growers; but there were still a number of young fellows who went
into training at the punch ball at the Church Institute club-room the
day they sowed their flower seeds, and so were at the top of their form
when the award was made in the early autumn, so that if one of them got
the prize he thought if a pity that his training and practice at the
punch ball should be wasted, and thus he was ready to prove to all
disputants that the prize had gone to the best man; while it was only to
be expected that those who had only had the cold consolation of honorary
mention were only too ready to dispute his ability to maintain such an
attitude for any length of time.

The result of this joint cultivation of bulbs and biceps was not just
what the givers of the prize intended to achieve, and twice, when there
had been arrests and summonses to petty sessions, a formal warning was
issued to all whom it might concern that if the connection between
the two cultures were not severed, the prize, which was only meant for
success in the one, would be withdrawn.

Happily, however, it was not found necessary to enforce this ultimatum,
and a _modus vivendi,_ founded upon one which had been understood to
work very satisfactorily in the case of the Chrysanthemum Society of
Mallingham, was adopted, and up to the present this had made for peace.
The annual Battle of Flowers at Thurswell has become a thing of the
past, and "Midge" Purcell, the ex-lightweight champion of the county,
who rents the Lion and Lamb Inn, and to whom the candidates for the
prize applied for advice on the biceps side of the joint contest,
affirms with regret that Englishmen are becoming degenerate.

It was a peace-loving florist at Mallingham, the honorary secretary
to the Chrysanthemum Society, who explained the system upon which his
committee had agreed to make their awards, and urged its adoption by
the Thurswell people. Its operation was not intricate. Its fundamental
principle may best be defined on the analogy of the rotation of crops as
the rotation of awards. Like the award of the Garter, merit had nothing
to do with its scheme. The prizes were awarded strictly in turn to the
professional competitors--the others did not matter. Mr. Johnson got the
chrysanthemum cup one year, Mr. Thompson the medal for the best twelve cut
lilies, Mr. Cardwell the Malmaison salver, and Mr. Prior the vase for
the best display of greenhouse ferns. The next year it was arranged that
the vase should go to Mr. Johnson, the salver to Mr. Thompson, and so
forth. By the adoption of this admirable plan the judges were saved a
large amount of trouble, and there never was any friction between the
competitors, for it was understood that if it was Prior's year for the
lily medal, but he had a liking for any other prize, he could nearly
always negotiate an exchange with the man whose turn had come for the
award that he fancied. This principle of give and take, live and
let live, had made the Mallingham Society one of the most popular
floricultural organisations in the country, and its adoption by the
Thurswell Committee of the Manor House prize brought about, as has been
said, an entire cessation of that ill-feeling which led to the use
of language that was certainly not the language of flowers, and to
many-discreditable scenes even when there were no arrests made. The
cause of peace has triumphed, though some people say that floriculture
languishes through the lack of heal thy rivalry; for when every man is
certain of the prize when his turn comes for it, he does not trouble
about the flowers. There may be something in this suggestion.

Taking one consideration with another, it really does seem a pity that
the rotation system is not more widely accepted by those societies which
have been established for the encouragement of sundry excellent objects,
such as the breeding of bull-dogs (for symbolic purposes), of pugs
(of no use to any one when they are bred), of pigs (of which the
prize-winner is invariably the most uneatable), and of pets (in various
forms). In our neighbourhood such organisations are to be numbered by
the dozen, and after every prize distribution the air is murmurous with
the complaints of disappointed competitors. It was a shrewd farmer who
suggested to me the principle on which the awards are made at our local
dog show. "The reason why there's so much grumbling, sir, is because the
judges look at the wrong end of the leash," he said, and I understood
what he meant.

[Illustration: 0061]

I know that the impression is very general that the pedigree of the
exhibitor rather than that of the exhibit influences the local judges.

But I must confess that I could not bring myself to sympathise with one
of our new residents who, after living in London all his life, bought
Harley Croft House, a 40 h.p. motor-car and six pairs of gaiters, and
set up as a country gentleman. It must be acknowledged that at times he
looked a colourable imitation of one. He hoped that his starting of
the breeding of cattle and fowl would consolidate his position. But his
researches in the literature of both subjects at the same time resulted
in some confusion. Of course his pointing out some drab-tinted cows
to the steward of the Manor and alluding to them definitely as Buff
Orpingtons was a slip that any one might make; but to hope to win
sympathy for a wrong done to him by the judges at the poultry show by
affirming that his bantam cock was really twice the size of the one to
which the prize had been awarded was, I think, a strategical mistake of
a flagrant character.

Much more in the spirit of the country gentleman was the remark made to
me by a neighbour who hunts five days a week in winter and talks about
hunting seven days a week in the summer, on a purely literary subject.
He had been at the Military Tournament in London the year that _The
Merchant of Venice_ was being played at Her Majesty's Theatre, and he
confided in me that he thought on the whole it was very fine indeed,
though for his part he enjoyed _The Runaway Girl_ at the Gaiety more
fully. He could not quite understand the point of some of the jokes in
_The Merchant of Venice_, he said. For instance, he should like to know
what there was to laugh at in the chap's saying to the Jew that some one
had shown him a turquoise which he had bought from the Jew's daughter
for a monkey. Any one who knew anything about precious stones knew that
to pay a monkey for a single turquoise, even though set in an 18-carat
ring, was to pay a fair price. Of course you couldn't get much of a
diamond ring for twenty-five pounds; but you could get a first-rate
turquoise for half the money. But there were some people, he knew,
who would laugh at any joke if they were only told it was in a play of
Shakespeare's. I agreed with him, and laughed.

That was not the sort of man who would make a fool of himself over
Buff Orpingtons or cherish his bantams in proportion to their size and
weight.




CHAPTER FOUR--THE COMEDIES OF THE COUNTRY HOUSE




I.--LESSEES FROM THE MIDLANDS

IT WAS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE second generation of one of the
shirt-sleeves families of the midlands who took a lease of Nethershire
Castle, the finest mansion in our neighbourhood. The Court of Chancery
had decreed that it might be let for a term of years, the length of
which was fixed by certain Commissioners in Lunacy, for Sir Ralph
Richards had been in the care of a specialist in mental diseases for
a long time, and it was understood that there were little hopes of his
ever being able to enjoy his own again. Higgins was the name of the
lessee from the north, and with his wife and family he had occupied the
Castle for close upon ten years. He was a simple enough man as regards
his tastes: he could not appreciate the beauty of the cedar wood ceiling
of the banqueting hall or the Renaissance carved panels of the library.
The splendid Gainsboroughs and Romneys of the Long Gallery made no more
appeal to him than did the Van Dycks in the great hall or the three
Fragonards of the drawing-room. He was quite satisfied with the
reputation of having sufficient money to pay for the privilege of living
in the midst of these masterpieces and of keeping about an acre and
a half of roof in good repair: he knew more about the advantages of
close-fitting slates than of the methods of eighteenth-century English
artists or of fifteenth-century Italian carvers.

His wife, however, valued to the full the artistic privileges of
living in so splendid a house, and she was not one to shrink before the
searching glances of Frances Anne, the wife of the first baronet of the
house of Richards, as painted by Sir Joshua, sacrificing to Venus, or
to assume that Lady Elizabeth had turned aside from making a libation
to Hymen--Hymen demanded quite as many sacrifices as Venus on
eighteenth-century canvases--to ask her what right she had to sit in the
seats of the Richards of Nethershire Castle. She knew what her husband
paid in the way of rent, and she felt that the same was large enough to
avert from her any indignant look that a sentimentalist might imagine on
the face of the most malevolent family portrait. In fact, Mrs. Higgins
considered the sum large enough to allow of her assuming the attitude of
the patroness in regard to the pictures: she had actually been heard by
a friend of the Richards to express a critical opinion respecting the
pose of the daughter of the second baronet--the one who became well
known as the Countess of Avonwater--in Romney's picture of her as
Circe, and to suggest that the charger of Lieut.-Colonel Jack Churchill
Richards--he was called after his father's great commander--in the
picture by Sir Godfrey Kneller was scarcely large enough to make a polo
pony. It was, however, clearly understood that these criticisms were
offered by the lady only by way of establishing her rights over the
contents of the mansion so long as her husband paid so handsomely as he
did for the privilege of such an entourage. She had probably heard of
certain rights-of-way being maintained by a formal walking over the
ground to which they referred, by the claimant, once a year, and so she
thought it well to walk over the pictures, so to speak, now and again to
show that she understood the rights of her position. She really felt
the greatest pride in everything, and in the course of a few years her
feeling in regard to them was that of a conscientious descendant from
illustrious ancestors. She was much prouder of them than the modern
Major-General in _Patience_ was of his ancestors acquired by purchase.

A visit that I paid to the Castle in the temporary possession of the
family of Higgins was illuminating. I went not because I had ever met
either Mr. or Mrs. Higgins, but because I was acquainted with Miss
Richards, a charming old lady who was the sister of the unhappy baronet,
and had been born in the Castle and lived there for twenty-five or
thirty years, only leaving for the dower-house on the death of her
mother.

Miss Richards was on the friendliest terms with the tenants of her old
home, and I could see that they were pleased to welcome all the friends
whom she might bring with her to see the wonders of the Castle. But it
was Mrs. Higgins who "did the honours" of the picture gallery, when we
went thitherward after tea one lovely afternoon in sum mer shortly after
I had come to Thurswell. It was Mrs. Higgins who assumed the rôle of
Cicerone and told me all about the pictures, and gave me duodecimo
biographies of the originals with all the familiarity that one would
expect only from a member of the family. Miss Richards stood by smiling
quite pleasantly, even when Mrs. Higgins looked at her, saying something
about a pink-coated Captain Richards by Raeburn, and I was disposed to
laugh at the comedy of Mrs. Higgins of Lancashire telling Miss Richards
of Nethershire something confidential about Captain Richards, her
great-granduncle!

I admired the picture, but not nearly so much as I did the coolness of
Mrs. Higgins and the kindly toleration of Miss Richards.

"And this is the portrait by Thornhill of Miss Esther Richards, who
afterwards married General Forster, who took part in the American War,
and to avenge the murder of poor André--he called it murder, though,
of course, some people think that André was really a spy," said Mrs.
Higgins. "Doesn't it seem strange to think of that sweet little girl-"

"Oh, pardon me," cried Miss Richards, "you are not quite right. That is
Lotitia Richards by North-cote. She married Sir Charles Brewster, who
was killed at Waterloo."

"Oh no," said the tenant, "you are quite wrong. I assure you that this
is Esther. Your Lotitia is the girl in Oriental costume in the library."

"My dear Mrs. Higgins, how could I possibly be mistaken over such a
matter?" said Miss Richards. "My dear mother told me how Letty Brewster
came here one day when she was eighty-two years of age, and how pathetic
it was to see her stand before her own picture done when a girl; but my
mother said that really some of the charm of the picture--she had lovely
eyes, as you can see--was apparent on the face of the dear old lady of
eighty-two."

"I am afraid that you are mixing this picture with another," said Mrs.
Higgins quite good-naturedly.

And then Miss Richards gave a laugh.

"We had better pass this picture and look at one which could not
possibly be mixed up with another," she said. "I hope you will agree
with me in believing that this is Hoppner's Lady Charlotte Richards,
Mrs. Higgins."

"Oh yes, you are quite right about _that one_," said Mrs. Higgins as
graciously as a governess commending the right answer given by an errant
pupil. "Oh yes, that is Lady Charlotte. I believe she became pious and
wrote a hymn. You have heard that, I suppose, Miss Richards?"

"I do believe I did," replied Miss Richards. "In fact, I have the tiny
volume of hymns which she wrote. She was under the influence of Lady
Huntingdon."

But Mrs. Higgins clearly took very little interest in Lady Huntingdon,
and she went down the gallery making mistake after mistake; but Miss
Richards never attempted to correct her--only once she caught my eye.
Mrs. Higgins had attributed the Master Richards of Lawrence to Sir Peter
Lely!

We were far away from the Castle before we had our laugh.

"Wasn't it really funny?" said Miss Richards.

"I think that you must be the most even-tempered person in the county,
if not in all England," said I.

The friendly relations existing between the two ladies were not at all
changed by the persistent patronage of the picture gallery by the one
who was the tenant, and Mrs. Higgins was always ready to offer a hearty
welcome to any of Miss Richards' friends and to do the honours of the
Castle. I did not, however, trespass upon her hospitality a second time.

A year or two later I met a curious sort of gentleman who bore the same
name as that of a family of considerable importance--county importance,
I should say, for outside a ten-mile radius they are, as is usually
the case, absolute nonentities. I had heard some say, however, that the
family grounds included a rather wonderful fountain which I thought
I should like to see. I asked the man if he was any relation to the
family, and he replied, brightening up wonderfully, that they were his
cousins.

"I believe they have a nice place," said I. "Isn't there a fountain that
came from the Villa Borghese? I am greatly interested in that sort of
thing."

"You must mean the one with the mermaids," said he.

"I dare say that is the one," said I.

"If you go in for things like that you should certainly see it," he
cried. "Let me see how I can manage it."

"You are very kind," said I. "But I could not think of bothering you in
the matter. I dare say that some day I shall have a chance----"

"I have it," he cried. "The family are going away for a fortnight at
Easter, and when they are gone I could easily show you over the grounds.
I'll just make sure of the day they leave, so that there may be no
mistake."

In spite of a promise of such lavish hospitality, I resisted the
temptation of being shown over the grounds in the way that was proposed:
the fact being that I had no confidence in my own ability to act the
part of the housekeeper's nephew or the second footman's uncle who are
admitted to the great house when the family are away.

I trust, however, that I convinced the enterprising cousin of the great
house that I fully appreciated his spirited offer to allow me a peep at
the Borghese fountain through a chink in the back door, as it were.

I learned subsequently that the great family started in a tannery in
Mallingham a hundred and twenty years ago. It was no wonder that any one
in my station of life could only be expected to approach their demesne
by a back way.




II.--THE LEGENDS OF THE COUNTRY HOUSE

On the subject of great houses, I may venture to say, it has always
seemed to me to show a singular lack of imagination on the part of some
one that one legend should be forced to do duty for so large a group,
and this legend so devoid of any stimulating quality. It seems to me
that the legends of the country houses of England are, like all Gaul,
divided into three parts. All through the south one is shown the room
in the mansion in which Queen Elizabeth slept. There is scarcely a Tudor
house in which that particular monarch did not sleep for at least one
night of her life, and so highly cherished is this family tradition that
I have known of cases in which she slept in a room at least sixty
years before the mansion itself was built. Then around London one is
constantly pointed out by local antiquaries the house in which Nell
Gwyn lived. "Madam Ellen" certainly seemed given to "flitting." A dozen
houses at least are associated with her name. North of the Tweed we are
confronted with the Mary Queen of Scots and the Bonnie Prince Charlie
legends. Any story that fails to touch upon the vague history of the
worthies whom I have ventured to name as presiding over each department
of tradition, seems to be regarded as uninteresting. Although monarchs
of quite as blessed memory as Queen Elizabeth must have slept in many
mansions in their time, yet few rooms are consecrated to the memory
of their slumbers, and although many ladies of the Court were quite as
deserving of having their memory enshrined or ensign-ed in the name of
a fully licensed public-house as Evelyn's "Impudent Comedian," yet none
seem to be regarded as so good a draw as Nell Gwyn. The chairs of Mary
Queen of Scots are as plentiful as the mementoes of the other Stuart
worthies. I myself have seen in a mansion an Italian cabinet which I
was assured had belonged to Queen Mary. But when I asked for evidence on
this point I found that there was none forthcoming. I did not get so
far as to make such an inquiry in the case of a mahogany looking-glass
offered to me by a foolish dealer south of the Tweed, who declared that
it had been in the possession of the same unfortunate lady. It was not
to me, however, that another dealer tried to sell a dagger that had once
been worn by the Young Pretender, the proof of its authenticity being
displayed in the roughly cut initials "Y.P.," evidently the work of
Bonnie Prince Charlie himself, on the leather sheath.

Generally speaking, I think it may be assumed that no monarch ever slept
in a room that was not built until he had been dead for a hundred years.
Fifty years should be accepted as the minimum for such an incident.
And the probabilities are that no relic of even the most easy-going
sovereign should be accepted as authentic that was not made within at
least ten years from the date of his or her death.

As for the legends of the member of the family who was known as "the
wicked lord" or "Black Sir Ughtred," there is a tiresome sameness about
them all, and most of them should be treated as overworn coins and
called in. For instance, there is the story of the dreadfully wicked man
of property--his portrait is usually in a panel over the fireplace in
the hall--who provoked a neighbour of whom he was jealous to fight a
duel with him after dinner one afternoon. They used pistols, taking aim
across the table that bore the decanters and wineglasses, and the wicked
gentleman shot his friend through the heart, but escaped the
consequences of the fell deed by inducing his companions to announce to
the world that the man had died simply of heart failure. The story is
plausible enough, if you assume that the coroner and the sheriff and all
the other authorities were three-bottle men, and it is easy to suppose
that in the early eighteenth century such high officials might be so
described; but there is no necessity to wind up the story by showing the
visitor the mark that the bullet made in the linen-fold wainscoting of
the dining-room. You see, that striking evidence of the scrupulous
accuracy of the story makes it essential for you to believe that the
fatal bullet passed through the worthy gentleman's heart and slued round
his backbone before lodging in the woodwork behind him, and this is
asking too much.

I do not suppose that there is a Parliamentary Division of any county in
England that does not contain a mansion with a room in which this duel
was fought. Upon one occasion I visited a lesser country house where
I happened to know a duel had been fought in the dining-room in the
eighteenth century. I did not venture to inquire of the owner if he had
heard of that tragic incident: I did not believe that he had; but when
I was examining a very spurious picture attributed to Canaletto, after
admiring a dexterous forgery of a rocky landscape by Salvator Rosa, he
drew my attention to a portrait of a "black-avised" gentleman in a wig,
and the story of the historical duel came out at once.

"I must show you the panel in the dining-room that was splintered by the
bullet," said my host; and though I did not insist, he kept his word.

"It is said," he continued, when I was looking at the imperfect
woodwork, "that the fellow was so stricken with remorse that he
would never allow the panel to be repaired, in order that he might be
constantly reminded of his deed; and it's a tradition in our family that
it is never to be repaired, so there it is to-day."

I did not make myself objectionable to the family by assuring them
that they might send for the carpenter any time they pleased without
offending the shades of their ancestors, for it so happened that that
particular duel was fought with swords and not with pistols.




III.--FATE OF THE FAMILY PORTRAITS

In connection with family traditions and family portraits there are
bound to be some grimly humorous episodes with the lapse of time, owing
to the exactions of those Chancellors of the Exchequer who have held
office since the creation of the Death Duties, as they are called. When
a man with no ready money of his own inherits an estate that has not
paid its expenses for many years, and a splendid mansion containing
about fifty pictures, which, according to the most recent auction-room
prices, may be worth from £100,000 to £150,000--people at picture sales
think in pounds and bid in guineas--the question that at once presents
itself is how to meet the demands of Somerset House. The fortunate heir,
without a penny in his pocket, is called on to hand over from £10,000
to £15,000, according to his relationship to the late owner, and he
wonders how he is to do it. In some cases that have come under my notice
the only feasible way out of the difficulty has been taken, and some
of the pictures have been sold in order to pay for the privilege of
retaining the others. In the case of some historical mansions, however,
every picture in the gallery is perfectly well known to the world, and
the heir has a good many more qualms about selling any of them than
Charles Surface had about disposing of his collection, with the
exception of "the little ill-looking fellow over the settee." He
feels--if he is capable of any feeling at all--that he is selling his
own flesh and blood, and he always wonders what people will say when
they come to visit the historical house and find blank panels in which,
for perhaps two or three hundred years, stately figures of men and
graceful figures of women had appeared.

What is he to do in such circumstances, while he is thinking his
thoughts on a settee in the hall, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer
is pulling away like mad at the wrought-iron bell handle outside and
telling the butler that his instructions are not to leave the place
until his bill is paid?

It seems that there is only one way by which the honour of the family
can be preserved. There are trusty agents who can negotiate for an
immediate and a secret sale of certain of the pictures. These are taken
out of their frames or out of their panels, copies are made and put
where the originals had been for years, and when the latter are passed
on to New York or Chicago, unsuspecting lovers of Art stand beneath
copies in admiration of the power of the Masters!

That is how the honour of the great family remains untarnished, while
the Chancellor of the Exchequer strikes a match on one of the stone
columns of the porch, lights his cigarette, and goes jauntily down the
avenue with a large cheque in his breast-pocket.

All very well this for the time being; but a little comedy may possibly
take place some years later, when once again Death Duties have to be
paid, and probably at an increased rate per cent. No note may have been
made of the pictures that were sold, and the copies have been subjected
to the admiration of visitors without a misgiving. There are, I
happen to know, copyists of Sir Joshua Reynolds and others of Thomas
Gainsborough, Romney, Raeburn, Lawrence, and the rest, of such skill in
reproducing the style of their particular Master that only the cleverest
connoisseur could say, after the lapse of a year or two, which are the
originals and which the copies. How, then, is a valuation to be made
when the new owner enters upon his inheritance?

I fancy that it will be discovered Masters than were suspected of it had
made replicas of their greatest works, and shipped off one to Chicago
while selling the other to the great English families who gave them the
order a hundred years or so ago.




CHAPTER FIVE--THE COUNTY, OLD AND CRUSTED




I.--THE STRANGERS

WHEN THE LATE MR. W. P. FRITH WAS AT the height of his fame, and
engravings of his "Derby Day" and "The Railway Station" contested for
prominence on the flowery flock-papered walls of many drawing-rooms with
Landseers "Monarch of the Glen," he went to pay a visit to his daughter
in a southern county, and she has placed it on record that when she
mentioned his name to the leaders of Society in various localities it
conveyed nothing to them.

Why should it convey anything to them? He did nothing but paint all his
life. Fame in painting, in music, in writing, means nothing--in many
cases rather less than nothing--to the society of any English county. If
the man had brought down a couple of hunters and gone out three times a
week to hounds, the people in his division of the county would talk
to you of him and look on you with astonishment if his name conveyed
nothing to you; and the wife of a retired country doctor who takes
up what is known as Church work--organising village teas and village
concerts and Sunday "Unions"--is at once accorded a position that counts
as fame in such communities in England.

But if it were not for observing these features in country life nothing
of its lighter side would be apparent. There is nothing so comical as a
picture in which all the laws of perspective are ignored; and living in
a country town in England is like placing oneself in the position of the
man in Edgar Allan Poe's story who, looking out of his window, saw
an immense and hideous monster--a thing with splay feet and a huge
proboscis--stalking with mighty steps across a distant lawn, and was
greatly perturbed until he discovered that the creature was only an
ordinary sort of spider walking across one of the strands of its web,
which was drawn across the window pane.

Every day one may have experience of people living in the midst of such
distorted perspective--fancying that the commonplace insects that move
before them are creatures of enormous proportions and importance, and
quite as frequently assuming that because an object appears small to
them, being far away from them, it is quite insignificant. If one
cannot find humour in observing the attitude of people who ignore the
conditions of perspective in this way, one must be stolid indeed.

A typical inhabitant complained to me very bitterly some time ago of
having just discharged a very thankless duty in respect of a stranger
who, at the instigation of his brother--a London barrister of some
repute--had called upon him in motoring through the county. He admitted
that the stranger was a nice enough sort of man, but wholly devoid of
appreciation of the relative importance of the persons whose houses were
pointed out to him from the summit of the old castle which the stranger
had been anxious to visit.

"I showed him Lord Riverland's place--as much of it as we could see
through the trees--but all he said was, 'Who is Lord Riverland?'"
continued the man, pouring his complaint into my ear. "And then I told
him that just beyond Eglam Church was the Shillingdales' place. 'Funny
name, Shillingdale!' was all that he remarked; but when we were leaving
the castle he saw the gable of Maxfield's house sticking out, and he
took a fancy to that tumbledown place and asked who lived there. I told
him. 'Maxfield,' he said. 'Not Laurence Maxfield, I suppose?' I said
that I believed his name was Laurence. 'What! Laurence Max-field, the
painter?' Yes, I said, I heard he was something in that line. Well,
you should have seen his face at that. 'How can I ever thank you
sufficiently for pointing out that house to me?' he cried. And when
we got down to the road he kept hovering about that place, and once he
said, 'What kind fate led me here to-day? And yet I might have gone away
without so much as glancing at the house of Laurence Max-field!' Now,
is it any wonder that I almost lost my temper? I had pointed out to the
fellow Riverland Park and Shillingdale Hall, and yet I don't believe he
ever heard of Lord Riverland, or knew that Captain Shillingdale had been
made a D.L. for the county! But he almost became maudlin over the two
old cottages that Maxfield knocked into one! A painter! The idea of
making a fuss over a painter!"

"You forget that the man was a total stranger to our neighbourhood,"
said I. "You must make allowances: he knew no better."

He said he supposed the fellow really did know no better; and I am
convinced that in his own way he abused his visitor to his wife for
the man's deplorable lack of all sense of proportion, to ignore the
privilege of having a distant view of the mansion of a deputy-lieutenant
of an English county and feasting his eyes on the cottage of a painter!

A more amusing example still of the insect being taken for the
mammoth was given to me by the person whose mammoth-like proportions
(intellectually) were neglected because all eyes were directed upon the
passage of an insignificant local insect across the line of vision.

He was a literary man whose name is known and respected in every part
of the world--not merely in that narrow republic known as the world
of letters. He was staying for a week at the house of a friend, when a
lady, who was getting up a charity concert at Ringdon, calling at the
house one day, and being told in a whisper by one of the daughters of
the family when walking through the garden that they had a celebrity
with them, entreated him to "do" something for the entertainment of her
audience: she didn't mind what it might be that he would do, if he only
agreed to do something.

Now it so happened that the lady had a more potent qualification
than persistence in making an appeal to a man--she was extremely
good-looking--and the man could not resist her importunity. He pro-mised
to tell some short stories at the concert, and, in accordance with the
terms of his promise, he turned up in the schoolhouse where the concert
was to take place, supported by his host and two of the family. But the
charming lady had not mentioned the fact that the entertainment was
to supplement a parochial tea, and when they arrived this part of the
programme was scarcely over. There were no printed programmes; only the
clergyman who presided had before him a list of the performers and the
nature of their performances, and he at once called upon a young woman
who played very prettily on the piano. A young man, who professionally
was the assistant to the Ringdon baker, was then called upon to sing the
"Death of Nelson," which he did without faltering. When the applause had
died away the clergyman rose from his chair and said--

"My dear friends, we have with us this evening a gentleman who has very
kindly consented to contribute to our entertainment. He is a gentleman
with whose name you will all be familiar. Were he not present I should
like to refer more particularly to his honourable career; for in his
presence I feel that it would not be good taste to do so, and, besides,
he is so modest that I know he would be set blushing even though I were
only to say one-half of all that was his due. My dear friends, I call
upon you to give a hearty welcome to Mr. Reuben Robinson, who has come
all the way from Netherham to give you his entertainment familiar to you
all, I am sure, under the title of 'Charlie and Charlotte.'"

The amateur ventriloquist went on the platform with his horrid puppets,
and the young people cheered him for several minutes.

Later in the evening the clergyman, without any preliminary discourse,
called upon the literary celebrity to tell his stories. Now throughout
the world this writer is known as Alec Bidford, and now for the first
time in his life he heard himself alluded to as Alexander Bedford; and
it became clear to him that the good clergyman had never heard his name
before!

Happily the victim of the beautiful lady's importunity has a keen sense
of humour, as any one who goes farther than the parson did, and reads
one of his books, will not need to be told, and I have never heard him
more humorous than when he refers to his selfconsciousness while the
clergyman was dealing with the fame achieved by--Mr. Reuben Robinson,
the amateur ventriloquist, who had come all the way miles from the
village of Netherham, where he sold bacon in the daytime. I do not
know what Alec Bid-ford's opinion is, but I do know that there are some
people who believe that this sort of discipline is good for one, whether
one may be a literary celebrity or some lesser personage. An appearance
in a Court of Law usually serves the same purpose; but it must be more
than irritating to a man whose name is known to and honoured by every
member of his own profession to be treated in the court with no more
consideration than is extended to the merest nonentity. The judge
professes never to have heard his name mentioned before, and, if he has
been a witness, refers to his evidence without thinking it necessary
to give him the ordinary prefix of "Mr." I have seen six of the most
distinguished literary men in England--popular men, too, as well as
geniuses--give evidence in a Court of Law, and yet the calling out of
name after name did not cause even one of the solicitors' clerks to
raise his head from the paper which he was reading, and the jurymen
chatted together without being in the smallest degree impressed by the
prospect of hearing the great one's voice.

This also is discipline, I suppose. At any rate, it suggests that a
provincial town is not the only place where a sense of proportion is
lacking.




CHAPTER SIX--THE OLD COUNTY TOWN




I.--IN THE HIGH STREET

IF OUR THURSWELL IS A TYPICAL English village, assuredly Mallingham is
a typical country town, only inclining to the picturesque side rather
than the sordid. Like most picturesque towns, it is more highly
appreciated by strangers than by its own inhabitants. Its one long
street crawls along a ridge of the Downs, and from the lower level
of the road that skirts this ridge and meanders among fat farms and
luscious meadows, with an old Norman church here and there embowered in
immemorial elms and granges mentioned in _Domesday Book_, steep lanes
of old houses climb to the business street. It is really impossible to
reach the town without a climb of some sort; and this fact, which made
the site an ideal one, from the standpoint of the mediaeval founders of
its walls and gates, remnants of which may yet be discovered by any one
searching for them in a true archaeological spirit, causes a good deal
of grumbling among the residents on both levels, who have to face many
climbs in the course of an ordinary day's work. But motoring strangers,
who pass through the town by the hundred every day, travelling between
the two fashionable coast resorts, glance down the narrow lanes and say,
"How simply lovely!" or "Doesn't it remind you of Nuremberg?" Perhaps
it does remind them of Nuremberg--I have known people who affected to
be reminded of Sorrento at Brighton--but for my part Mallingham only
reminds me of an English country town, the convenient centre for a
ten-mile area of villages. Enough business is done in its properly
called High Street to allow of two banks keeping their doors open, and
of half a dozen shopkeepers making modest fortunes in the course of a
hundred years or so, and retiring from their half-timbered places of
business to the avenue of red brick villas with well fires and radiators
which an enterprising "developer" of one of the manors perceived to be
a long-felt want. But the shops go on from generation to generation with
the old names over the front, and in many cases with the family of the
new generation living on the premises in the good old way. Only in this
sense, however, may the tradesmen be said to be "above their business";
there is not the least disposition on the part of any of them to appear
anything beyond what they are, for the simple reason that they do not
think that the world holds anything better than a Mallingham tradesman.
And, indeed, I am not sure that the world holds anything less ambitious.
The aspirations of most of them do not go beyond the acquiring of a
plate-glass frontage. Occasionally this dream literally crystallises,
and when the crates are known to be actually awaiting delivery at
the Goods Station, the "consignee" of the waybill is pointed out to
strangers by the simple casement shopkeepers with bated breath and an
occasional break in the voice. It is understood that the plate-glass
front can only be achieved by a limited number of traders, and for years
it was accounted a gross piece of presumption for any one whose lineage
as a shopkeeper could not be traced through at least three generations
of bill-heads to make a move in the direction of a "front"; but just
before last Christmas a bolt from the blue fell upon the astonished
town, for the two demure old ladies who kept a small millinery shop
(with gloves and table linen at the farther end) put up bills on
their small latticed window announcing a cheap sale in consequence of
"impending alterations." Now that particular shop front had remained
unchanged for certainly a hundred and fifty years--perhaps two hundred
and fifty years--and the two old maiden ladies who had looked after it
for close upon half a century seemed the most conservative of persons,
so it was taken for granted that the alterations which were "impending"
had reference only to the affixing of a new sun-blind in good time for
the summer, or perhaps an outside lamp to make the winter nights more
cheerful.

After a considerable amount of discussion on the subject an informal
deputation waited upon the ladies to obtain information on a matter
which, it was understood, affected the well-being of the whole
community, and which was approaching a stage when a specific
pronouncement one way or another was absolutely necessary.

Then it was that the truth was revealed. The maiden ladies had,
they confessed, been surreptitiously discussing the putting in of a
plate-glass front, and they had come to the conclusion that as they
were both old and life at best was uncertain, they should not any longer
procrastinate the carrying out of a scheme which the growth of the town
and its increasing importance fully warranted, they thought.

It took just four days to fix the new front in its place; but it was the
topic of the town for months, and even now you will see an occasional
group of town people discussing the innovation and wondering what things
are coming to.

The dimensions of the topic were, as I ascertained for my own
satisfaction, nine feet broad by seven feet high. This was the _premier
pas_. It led to the extravagance of a sunk letter sign, picked out
in gold, an outside lamp, and a spring sun-blind, all of the most
conventional pattern, and all to my mind in the condition of the "party
in a parlour" in the Wordsworth parody. In short, a charming old house
with many features of interest was transformed into a foolish hybrid
thing--a single sheet of plate-glass on the ground floor, beneath
two pairs of small cottage casements with delightful stone eaves. So
prosperity turns out the picturesque or, at least, relegates it to the
basement, and so a street with all the charm of past centuries clinging
to it is fast becoming commonplace, and strangers driving through it
laugh at the feeble attempts to give the commercial air of Harrods to
a row of cottages--about as sensible a proceeding as it would be to
attempt to assimilate the façade of Hampton Court with that of Hampton's
in Pall Mall.

Happily there are still some sixteenth-century eaves left and also some
eighteenth-century bow windows--the gentle curved bow of the
eighteenth century, not the detestable obtuse-angle things of the
mid-nineteenth--and happily the spirit of commercial enterprise does
not pervade the entire community. Several of the houses that have been
turned into shops contain admirable chimneypieces and panelled rooms,
with an occasional fire-back and basket grate. It seems, too, that there
must have lived in the place a century or so ago a master workman with a
great fancy for decorating chimneypieces after the style of Adam; for
in many of the rooms of sixteenth-century houses may be found quite good
examples of the early style of Robert Adam. In one house there is a fine
parlour decorated throughout in this way.




II.--PRECIOUS PANELLING

Some time ago a mason, while doing some repairs in a room in a very old
timbered house, disclosed some oak panelling which probably belonged
to the sixteenth century. The news of the discovery went abroad, and a
collector of "antiques" in the neighbourhood bought the woodwork for
a hundred pounds--far more than it was worth, of course, but that is
nothing; the effect of the find and of the sale was disastrous to the
occupants of other old houses, for they forthwith summoned masons and
carpenters and began pulling down their walls, feeling sure that a
hundred pounds' worth of panelling was within their reach. They were all
disappointed; for several years had passed before the landlord of the
chief hotel--it had once been the county town house of a great local
family--found behind the battens which served as the stretchers of the
canvas that bore some very common paper in his coffee-room, a long range
of oak wainscoting covered with paint. The usual local antiquary made
his appearance, and through dilating upon its beauty and abusing the
vandalism that had spread those coats of paint upon the oak, induced the
landlord to give the order to have the panels "stripped" and made good.
He little knew what he had let himself in for! The carpenters and the
painters attacked the room with spirit (of turpentine), and for weeks it
remained in their hands; for it was found that at least twenty coats of
paint were upon the woodwork, and that a great portion of it was only
held together by the paint, so that with the removal of this binding
medium the panels became splinters.

Before the end of a profitless six weeks the good landlord was wishing
with all his heart that that relic of a bygone period had been allowed
to rest comfortably buried beneath the papered canvas that had entombed
it all. The bill that he had to pay for the restoration was for such a
sum as would have been sufficient to buy the same quantity of absolutely
new panelling, he explained to some people to whom he went for sympathy!
He laid great stress upon the fact that he could actually have got new
panelling for the price of repairing the old!

[Illustration: 0103]

And this was the spirit in which a far-seeing but non-antiquarian lady,
who lived in another ancient house in the same street, received the
liberal offer of a gentleman from the United States who had taken a
fancy to her oak staircase. It was a commonplace type and might be found
by the dozen in any old town; but he told her that he would pay her a
hundred pounds for it, and she jumped at his offer. The staircase was
carted away and a new one of serviceable deal, absolutely fresh from the
carpenter's shop, was put in its place.

Her example induced a relation of hers--also a maiden approaching the
venerable stage--to sell the panelling of one room, the fireplace of
another, the Georgian pillared cupboards of a third, and actually
the old black and white slabs of the square hall. Hearing of all this
selling going on, an enthusiast made her an offer for the pillared porch
of the house, and another for the leaden cistern on the roof and the
copper rain-water head. Last of all, a man who was building a house in
imitation of the old in the neighbourhood set covetous eyes upon her
twisted chimney-pots and some peculiar coping tiles on the roof. She
accepted every offer--with modifications; but when she had fulfilled her
part of the business she found herself a solitary figure amid the ruin
of a nice house, but with a nice little sum in her pocket. It was at
this juncture that an enterprising tradesman from Brindlington, who was
on the look out for "branches," came upon the half-dismantled house.
Thinking that it was about to be pulled down, he made inquiries about
it, and these he considered so satisfactory that he bought, at a good
price, all that the previous speculators had left of it, completed their
work of demolition, and within six months had erected upon the site
some "desirable business premises" in the cheapest red brick, with an
inconceivable broad expanse of plate-glass which he called somebody's
"Co-operative Stores." He had co-operated with so many people in
carrying out the work of destruction in regard to the old premises, it
seemed only fit that the same principle should be maintained in their
reconstruction. The place is only a branch establishment, but it is said
to be flourishing as well as the parent tree.




III.--THE AMENITIES OF THE HIGH STREET

Every here and there between the shops in the High Street is a
house that has survived the request--it never amounts to a demand
in Mallingham--for "business premises." Quite unpretentious is the
appearance of all these houses, but the front door opens upon a hall
that is a hall, and not a mere passage to a narrow staircase. Admirably
proportioned rooms are to be found on every floor, and usually a door at
the farther end of the hall admits one to a garden, and not a mere patch
of green. Here are gardens that have been cultivated for hundreds of
years and so artfully designed that each of them has the appearance of a
park, with lawns, and terraces, and pergolas. Here, not thirty feet
back from the street, are acres of orchard, with mulberry trees of the
original stock introduced by James I. to make possible his scheme of
English silk weaving. The arbutus has also a home in several of
these surprising pleasure grounds, with several other rare but fully
acclimatised flowering shrubs. Shady walks among giant lilacs and
laburnums lead to banks of roses and beds of lilies, and hardy borders
of brilliant colour such as a stranger could never fancy might be found
in so unpromising a region.

The lucky residents in these wonderful houses are usually extremely
exclusive--if they were not so, goodness only knows what might happen.
When a lady of good family finds herself living next door to a grocer
and an ironmonger, she is bound to take steps to prevent the possibility
of any one fancying that she belongs to that _galère_, and the steps
that some of them take with this fact in their mind are sometimes very
diverting. They usually assume the form of ignoring the existence,
not so much of the grocer and the ironmonger as of the other ladies
similarly situated. If you call upon Miss Wheatly at No. 10 High Street
and, after praising up her garden, refer to the garden of Miss Keightley
at No. 20, Miss Wheatley will express great interest, saying she has
often heard that Miss Keightley's garden is quite charming, but she
has never seen it for herself. Miss Keightley on her side may go
even further, and not merely pretend that she has never heard of Miss
Wheatley's garden, but also that she had no idea that any one named
Wheatley lived in the town. This is at first, but she occasionally
betrays a scrupulous anxiety to be accurate by asking, "What did you say
the name was? Wheatley? Oh yes, to be sure I remember hearing the other
day that a Miss Wheatley lived at No. 10. And you say she has a nice
garden?"

And these good ladies may have been living within a few doors of one
another for forty odd years, and the father of the one may have been in
the butter trade, while the father of the other was in eggs.

The social distinctions in a country town such as Mallingham are
sometimes very pathetic. It might be thought that the people would find
a bond of union in that illiteracy which they enjoy in common, or in
that profound ignorance of everything connected, however distantly, with
art or science in which they live from one end of the year to the other;
but one does not find it so. Mallingham is perhaps the most ill-informed
town in England on all matters pertaining to culture, whether literary
or artistic. A stranger who was unacquainted with this fact thought he
was scoring a point in a speech which he had been called on to make in
the absence of the Member for the Division at the annual banquet of
the Barham Trust--the most important incident of the winter in
Mallingham--when he remarked that he felt that the town must be the
centre of the greatest literary activity; for, motoring through the High
Street, he found on one of the shop signs the name Swift, on another
the name Smollett, a little farther on he came upon an Addison (great
applause), and finally he found himself close to the house of Hume.
Surely, he said, these names spoke for themselves.

They had need to, for none of the élite of Mailingham could speak for
any of them, except Addison, for Mr. Addison was a pork butcher, who the
day before had been elected a member of the Corporation, after a hard
struggle with a saddler. It so happened that the bearers of all the
other literary names were not applaudable people--two of them were
definitely unpopular--but the name of Mr. Addison was received with
cheers, not by reason of his connection with _The Spectator_, but simply
because of his recent achievement, and no one at the banquet had the
least idea what the orator was referring to in bringing forward that
string of names. "He might surely have mentioned Mr. Fawley, who was
twice Mayor, or George Hanson, who has just bought the saw mills," a
prominent burgess remarked to me when I was in his shop the next day.
"But what has Peter Swift done, or Tom Smollett, or even Walter
Hume? Decent enough men, I don't deny, but out of place when named in
prominence at the Barham Banquet."

I never met anyone in the town who had heard these names in any other
connection than that of Mailingham shopkeepers.

Some time later a new curate at St Bartholomew's, when proposing a vote
of thanks to the chairman of one of his social meetings (with a magic
lantern and an amateur ventriloquist), became erudite and droll by
referring to "what Dr. Johnson said about music." The next day one
of the churchwardens--a land agent--asked him how on earth he could
attribute such a sentiment to Dr. Johnson. "I knew Dr. Johnson as well
as most people, and there never was a man in the town who enjoyed a
song better or knew better what a good song was," he said; and when the
perplexed curate recovered himself sufficiently to be able to explain
that there was another Dr. Johnson who said things besides the person of
the same name who had once enjoyed quite a large and lucrative practice
as a fully qualified veterinary surgeon at Mallingham, the churchwarden
smiled and shook his head. "As much as to say," the clergyman added in
telling me the story--"as much as to say that my excuse was far from
plausible, but that he would accept it to prevent the matter going
farther."

That narrative I found to be beautifully typical of the literary
erudition of Mallingham.




IV.--THE TWO ICONOCLASTS

Some four or five miles away are the imposing ruins of a great abbey
of the Franciscans. It had once been of so great importance in the land
that when the archabbey wrecker decreed that it should be demolished,
he sent his most trustworthy housebreaker to carry out his orders. Now
everybody of education in Mallingham can tell you all that is known
about the venerable ruin, and it is the pride of the town that it should
be so closely connected with the history of the Abbey; but I have never
yet met with any layman in the neighbourhood who was not under the
impression that the crime of its destruction should be added to the
pretty long account of that Cromwell who was called Oliver, and I should
not like to be the person who would suggest that there was another
Cromwell--one who did not decapitate his king, but whom his king
decapitated.

For that matter, however, it must be acknowledged that the people of
Mallingham do not stand alone in mixing up those iconoclasts. I have
found that in many parts of England as well as Ireland every deficiency
in the features of a church figure or a church ornament is attributed to
the later Cromwell. In Ireland I have had pointed out to me by clergymen
of both churches the headless saints and the broken carvings caused by
the fury of "Cromwell," though I knew perfectly well that the work of
sacrilege could not have been done by him, for two reasons, the first
being that in his devastating progress through Ireland he had never
approached the places in question, and the second being that the sacred
buildings in which the damage was done had not been built until long
after Cromwell had sailed for England, after being soundly-beaten at
Clonmel.

Of course in Ireland there was only one "curse of Cromwell"; but
in England I soon found that there were two, and so the progress of
confusion began, until at the present time, when you are visiting any
old church and see in a niche an adult saint with a broken nose, or a
carved rood screen deficient about the rood, the verger--sometimes the
rector himself--is quite fluent in explaining that the heavy hand of
Cromwell must be held accountable for the spoliation. If you ask which
of the two, the answer will most certainly be, "Why, Cromwell to be
sure--Cromwell--Oliver Cromwell."

An outsider should not interfere. The shade of Oliver would not shudder,
even if such an expression of emotion were permitted the shadiest of
shades, at the accusation being directed against him instead of the
older Cromwell. He would probably say, if speech were allowed to him,
"I have the greatest possible satisfaction in allowing my name to be
associated with any act of iconoclasm of the nature of those acts so
conscientiously perpetrated by my distinguished countryman."

He would feel that, could he have had any hand in smashing in the roofs
of monasteries and despoiling rich abbeys, it would be accounted to him
for righteousness. After such splendid acts of spoliation, knocking the
nose off a poorly carved saint could not but seem a paltry thing, quite
unworthy of any man with a reputation for a heavy hand to maintain.

But Mallingham, for all its literary and historical ignorance, has its
heart in the right place; and it is staunch to Church and State--staunch
to the core. Every Fifth of November it has its procession emblematic
of these principles, and it must be confessed that the symbolism of
the movement is not exclusive. To express adequately the loyalty of
Mallingham, it is found necessary to set forth in marching order Turks,
male and female, Negroes, Zulus, Toreadors, Pierrots, Harlequins,
the Archbishop of Canterbury, Pirates, Mary Queen of Scots, Firemen,
Dragoons, William Shakespeare, a Sailor, and many other characters, all
of whom, it must be taken for granted, typify the triumph of Loyalty.
Should any question a-rise--for captious inquirers may always be
reckoned on in these days of high educational achievement--as to the
identity of the leading typical figure in this pageant and the reason
of the obloquy that is heaped upon him, culminating in the stake, with
foul-mouthed explosives, the answer is that he is one Guy Fox, and
that he is paying the penalty of having failed to blow up the Houses
of Parliament. After that explanation no one can doubt that, whoever he
was, he richly deserves his fate--or should it be spelt _fête?_

Occasionally co-opted with him is an unpopular person of distinction in
the neighbourhood--a clergyman who lies under the stigma of preaching
toleration, a police superintendent with a constitutional distaste for
bonfires and low-flash explosives in the public streets, or perhaps a
District Visitor suspected of "leanings." But usually by midnight the
worst is over, and good nature without intoxicants prevails throughout
the motley crowd; the Archbishop of Canterbury lights his cigarette--one
of the packet with the pictures--from that of the Pirate King; Mary
Queen of Scots hurries to the house where she discharges the duties of
parlour-maid, complaining to a sympathetic Shakespeare that she has to
be up at six in the morning to let in the sweep, and so home to bed.

The only literary fact which is impressed upon all the townspeople is
that by some way never made quite clear, the singeing effigy, whose
obsequies have been so imposing, was responsible for a _Book of
Martyrs._ The general idea is that he was responsible for the martyrs
themselves, and that Foxes _Book of Martyrs_ is a sort of catalogue with
descriptive text of his victims.

So, as has been stated, the two Cromwells have but a single identity in
the minds of Mallingham.




V.--THE SOCIAL "SETS"

Of course there is in Mallingham, as in every other country town, a
first set and a second set--perhaps even a third, but that must be very
close indeed to the unclassed tradesmen set, which is no set at all. And
here it may be mentioned that the tradesmen's families are, as a rule,
very much more refined and almost invariably better educated than
the families of the first or second sets. Some years ago there was an
amateur performance of one of Mr. Sutro's delightful plays given in aid
of some deserving charity. Charity performances cover, as does Charity
itself, a multitude of sins, but the leading lady did not need to make
any appeal for leniency, so ably did she represent the part of the
refined woman who was not quite sure whether she loved her husband or
not. She was the daughter of a professional man, but had never succeeded
in getting into the first set; for it must be remembered that there
is no graduating from one set to another: one is either accepted
or rejected at once. A couple of years later, however, the play was
repeated, only this time it was under the highest patronage, so the
management resolved to get the real thing. They managed to secure the
services of a lady of title for the chief part, and the result was
appalling. The refinement had vanished from the part, so had the correct
pronunciation of the English language, so had the good taste in the
toilettes worn, so had every vestige of intelligence. In place of these
we were shown a pert young person with a voice like that of a barmaid
in a country inn and a taste in dress to correspond. In the matter of
memory for the words of the dialogue also the advantage was certainly on
the side of the humbler representative of the part. In one of Mr. Henry
James' most delightful short stories the catastrophe of "The Real
Thing" is depicted. It was not more pronounced than that of the second
representation of the comedy.

[Illustration: 0113]

It is really very difficult to understand what are the qualifications
for the best set in Mallingham; but somehow people usually find
themselves in the set that suits them, and very seldom do the rulers of
the social grades in Mallingham make a mistake. They have now and again
sailed very close to the wind, however; for that was a nasty rub they
got when they hastened to call upon a stranger, with the title of
Baroness, who had taken a house in the new part of the town and kept a
man-servant. As the story was told me, the ladies jammed one another in
the doorway in their anxiety to be the first caller upon the Baroness,
or Madame la Baronne, as the wife of a retired Indian civil servant
called her, having studied the idioms of the _Comédie française_.
Madame la Baronne was indeed a lady of great personal charm, and she was
invited everywhere--even to the villa of the wife of the leading
brewer, which represented a sort of Distinguished Strangers' Gallery in
Mallingham. The competition among the most select for the presence of
Madame at their houses was strenuous; and as she was in such demand
it really should not have been regarded as so surprising that a London
magistrate should send her a peremptory invitation by the hand of two
detectives to come to the court over which he presided. His messengers
would take no denial, he wanted her so badly, so she had perforce to
throw over her local engagements and grant the magistrate the favour
which he requested of her.

Her portrait was in the _Daily Mirror_ the next day, in connection
with a startling series of headlines, beginning, "The Bogus Baroness
Again--Arrest at Mallingham." She was one of the most notorious
swindlers that France ever returned to her native shore, after a series
of exploits in Paris.

The ladies of Mallingham ran up against one another in the porch of her
villa in their haste to get back the cards they had left upon her.




VI.--THE CASE OF MR. STANWELL

That was what might be termed "a close call" upon the dignity and
discrimination of the leaders of Society in Mallingham, and this was
possibly why they held back when a man and his wife bearing the name
Stanwell took a house in the town. The lady seemed quite nice and the
man was passable, and before they had "settled down" it was noised
abroad that they had a car: it need scarcely be said that to "have a
car" is in country districts nowadays as sure a sign of respectability
as "driving a gig" was in the 'thirties. There seemed to be no reason
why these people should not be called upon by the leaders of Mallingham
Society; but the leaders were getting more cautious than ever since the
Baroness' scandal, and they hung back, none of them wishing to take a
step which it would be impossible to recall, and every day the question
of to call or not to call was informally discussed. It was just at this
critical moment, when the fate of the Stanwells was trembling in the
balance, so to speak, that one of the leaders was visited by a London
friend, and on the name Stanwell being mentioned, this person asked,
"Is that Herbert Stanwell, the author? It must be. I heard that he was
leaving London and going to live in the country. They are all going.
Soon we shall not have an author left in London; though I remember the
time when they all lived there."

"This Mr. Stanwell has a car, I hear," was the "feeling" suggestion made
by the Mallingham lady.

"So has Herbert Stanwell--he has been photographed in it dozens of
times. Dear me! To think of Herbert Stanwell coming down here!" was the
exclamation of the visitor; and the moment that she had gone back to
London her hostess rushed round to her partners in the government of
social Mallingham, and breathlessly announced that she had discovered
that Mr. Stanwell was an author and that Mrs. Stanwell was his wife.

"Good heavens!" was the whispered exclamation from the syndicate. "Who
would have believed it? And we were actually thinking of calling upon
them! And they look quite respectable."

"And have a car!"

"Car, or no car, what I tell you is the truth. Is he not 'H. Stanwell?'
and the authors name is Herbert. There's no doubt about it. And my
friend, who knows everybody in London, said that Herbert Stanwell was
about to live in the country."

She assumed the pose of a Princess Hohenstïel Schwangau, saviour of
Society, and she and her friends talked of how providential were certain
incidents, let scoffers say what they might; for if she had not by the
merest accident--ah, a providential accident!--mentioned the name of the
Stanwells, no one would have known anything about them, and they might
have been visited quite in good faith.

They parted, feeling that Providence was, very properly, mindful of
the best interests of Mallingham; and so it was decreed that the
newcomers--that pair who had made the attempt to get within the citadel
of Mallingham's exclusiveness, not storming it boldly, but by the
insidious device of concealing the fact that at least one of them was
the author of over twenty novels--were not to be called on, although
they had a car.

Before a month had passed, however, _The Happy Home_, a magazine widely
circulated at Mallingham on account of its admirable paper patterns,
contained an interview with Herbert Wilfred Stanwell, giving an
excellent protrait of the distinguished author sitting (as usual) in
his motor-car, with his favourite Chow, _Ming_, beside him; and the
"letterpress" stated that he was unmarried, and that he had just taken
a charming cottage at Henley (illustrated), on the lawn of which
(illustrated), it might be taken for granted, all that was illustrious
in Literature, Art, and the Drama would be found at week-ends during the
summer, Mr. Stanwell's hospitality being proverbial.

The next day cards were left upon Mr. H. Stanwell and his wife, and it
was universally admitted that they formed quite a congenial addition to
Mailing-ham Society. He was a pleasant man and she was a charming woman.
They came to Mallingham with a clean bill of health. Neither of them had
done anything in the world, and the only time their names had appeared
in the newspapers was when they had been married. They were nonentities
to their finger-tips, and they soon took a high place among the
nonentities of Mallingham.

Mr. Stanwell sorrowfully admits that more than once he has been asked in
hotels in France and Italy if he was any relation to Herbert Stanwell,
the great author. It is very annoying, he says, but he hopes to live it
down. If he continues to live at Mallingham, he may be assured that his
hopes run every chance of being realised.

It is greatly to be feared that the leading "note" of Mallingham is not
literature. It is Thurswell that occasionally lays claim to be a great
reading centre. It was in the most friendly spirit of honest patronage
that a lady addressed a letter to George Eliot, commending some of the
characters in _The Mill on the Floss_, but regretting that the story had
not a happy ending.

"But it never reached him," she said. "I had sent it under cover to
the publishers, but they returned it to me, with a scrawl across it,
evidently done by a clerk, saying, '_Present address of_ George Eliot
not known, so, after all my trouble, it never reached him."

Having mentioned _The Mill on the Floss_, I feel bound to say that
neither in Thurswell nor Mallingham did the sporting innkeeper live who,
on seeing a cheap edition of the book advertised, at once sent for it
and read the greater part of it before he found out that he had been too
hasty in taking for granted that it was written round a prizefight. A
"mill" meant to him primarily such an incident, and his excursions into
the magic realms of literature had practically been confined to the
spirited accounts given incertain weekly papers of such encounters. A
mill as an industrial building conveyed quite a secondary idea to him.
He admitted to a friend of mine who found the book in the bar parlour,
and wondered how it got he had been "had" over it, and his faith in the
accuracy of literary advertisements got a severe jar. How was he to
tell, he asked, that the chap meant another sort of mill?

How, indeed?




CHAPTER SEVEN--THE PEOPLE OF MALLINGHAM




I.--THE MAYOR

ONE OF THE PECULIARITIES OF MALLINGHAM is the Mayor, for Mallingham has
a Mayor all to itself, except when, by virtue of his office, he spends a
happy day on various County Benches, joining with the representatives
of local county families in the administration of Petty Sessions
justice--Petty Sessions justice is founded on "good Crowner's Quest
law"--otherwise he is usually a very worthy man, and lays no specious
claim to popularity. He is never ostentatious or self-assertive, and in
spite of the position which he occupies, he is in private life as sound
an exponent of domestic virtue as if he were an ordinary simple citizen.
The eminence to which he has risen never makes him lose his head or
forget that kind hearts are more than coronets, and only very little
inferior to a Mayoral Chain of office. It was the proud but very proper
boast of a Mayor of Mallingham that although he had been proprietor of a
provision business in the very centre of the town for over forty years,
and had worn the chain for two consecutive terms, he was still just as
approachable as any man in the kingdom.

Just as it was said in the Napoleonic days that every French soldier
carried the _bâton_ of a Field-Marshal in his knapsack, and as it is
said in these days in the States that any citizen may one day become
President--the contingency may account for the gloomy view so many
American citizens take of life--so it is understood that any burgess of
Mallingham may one day become Mayor. There is, however, no competition
for the office, so unambitious are the majority of the burgesses; and
now and again the Council find themselves face to face with the problem
of how to induce any one to accept the chain of office.

Considering all that its acceptance entails upon the wearer, it can
easily be understood that there should be some reluctance to have
anything to do with it within the ranks of the eligible. If it were an
understood thing that the burgesses of the town must buy their bacon
and butter from the Mayor during his term of office, the problem of
the Mayoralty might become less acute--assuming that a bacon and butter
candidate were available; but no suggestion of this sort has ever been
made so far as I can gather, and thus the difficulty is increasing year
by year with the using up of all the available material for Mayors in
the rough.

The fact is, that a great deal too much is expected from the Mayor.
There is an inaugural banquet every year at which some two hundred
burgesses, and several of the local gentry, and Members of Parliament,
with a bishop, a rural dean, and an occasional chaplain to the forces,
sit down on the invitation of the incoming Mayor.--He is expected to pay
for everything, and as the feast is founded on the noblest traditions
of civic catering, his bill cannot but be a heavy one. In no way is
the menu inferior in interest to that to be found on the table of the
Mansion House in the City of London. As a matter of fact, I believe that
the turtle soup served at the Mallingham banquet is a trifle richer
than that in the Mansion House, and the champagne is possibly a little
sweeter. But the status of the large proportion of the guests at the
one is widely different from that of the majority at the other.
In Mallingham the tradesmen--gas-fitters, grocers, tobacconists,
hair-cutters, newsagents, and the like--who are probably accustomed to
a midday dinner of a cut from the joint, two vegetables, cheese, and a
glass of ale, and want nothing better, work their way through a long and
elaborate succession of dishes, between the _hors d'ouvres assortis_ and
the home-grown pineapple, drinking glass after glass of Ayala,
_cuvée reservée_. Of course they may appreciate some of the simpler
delicacies--_vol-au-vent_ or the _faysans rotis_--but the most of the
dishes are mysteries to them and, though very expensive, altogether
obnoxious to the uneducated palate.

To be sure, the banquet is artfully meant: it is supposed to be by way
of so incapacitating the diners that they are forced to listen to the
speeches that follow. Only by the adoption of such stringent measures
would it be possible to get a hearing for those speeches, made in all
solemnity by the gentlemen at the High Table. A loyal Mayor has been
known to spend twenty minutes over the Royal Family, after the King and
Queen had been honoured--he took a quarter of over Their Majesties; but
then the evening was comparatively young, and "The Bishops and Clergy of
the Established Church," "The Clergy of other Denominations," "The
Member of Parliament for the Division," "The Worshipful the Mayor," "The
Corporation of Mallingham," "The Official Staff," "The Town and Trade of
Mallingham"--all these had to be proposed and replied to in due course,
and the general opinion was that in making up the accounts, with the
banquet on the credit side and the speeches on the debit, a large
balance remained against the Mayor.

And the inaugural banquet is merely the first of the series of
entertainments which are supposed to come from the same source. Two or
three balls, as many garden parties, and at least four large receptions,
with refreshments, are looked for by the townspeople of all grades, for
even the most exclusive of the leaders of the best set do not object to
be entertained at the expense of the Mayor. They consider it their
duty to attend the dances as well as the receptions; but there the
transaction ends so far as they are concerned. They feel that they are
honouring him by accepting his hospitality, and they do not consider
that they are under the obligation to recognise him or his family if
they meet in the public street, nor do they think it necessary to invite
him or any member of his family to their houses. They really believe in
their hearts that they lay the Mayor under an obligation to themselves
by attending his receptions and his dances.




II.--THE FIRST FAMILIES

That is the attitude of these good people whose names are quite unknown
outside Mallingham. They are amusing through the entire lack on their
part of a sense of comedy.

I am inclined to think, however, that the attitude of a son of one of
these First Families, in respect of an incident that came under my
notice, might be more definitely described. He had been invited by a man
who was in a far better social position than himself to have a day with
the partridges in a shooting which he leased; the youth accepted, and on
the morning of the day named appeared in a dog-cart, bringing with him
a friend with another gun. They passed the man who had given the
invitation, and who was walking to the first field and had still a mile
or so to go before reaching it; but though there was a vacant seat in
the dog-cart he was not asked to take it. They drove gaily on, and did
not even wait for him to come up with his dogs to begin operations. One
of them was walking up one side of the field and the other was walking
up the parallel side. The lessee of the shooting, on arriving, found
himself taking rather a back place, the fact being that he had no
acquaintance with his friend's friend, and his friend apparently not
thinking it necessary to introduce him. The shoot went on, however,
and, save for a little grumbling at the working of the dogs, it was
successful enough. On getting round to the dog-cart, after walking
through the last field, the visitors collected the birds that they had
shot and tucked them under the back seat, and mounting to the front
called out a cheery "good-bye" to the man who had entertained them.
They were about to drive off, but the breaking strain of the other's
politeness had been passed.

"I shouldn't mind a lift from you," he suggested.

"Sorry," explained the one with the reins; "but you see how rough the
lane is, and really the machine is too heavy as it is. Ta-ta."

"On minute," said the pedestrian. "If it's too heavy I'll jolly soon
remedy that," and he took a step to the dog-cart and pulled out the
birds. "Pity you didn't think of that before. Now it's lighter. Off you
go, and the next time you are offered a day's shooting you just inquire,
from some one who knows, how you should behave. You will in that way be
prevented from appearing a complete bounder."

For some time afterwards there was a sort of coldness between that man
and the First Family, whose representative had been prevented by him
from adding three brace of partridges to their menu for the next week.

For a plentiful lack of good manners the representatives of the "best
set" in Mallingham could scarcely be surpassed in any community. The
youth probably was quite sincere in his belief that he was conferring
a conspicuous favour upon the man who had invited him to an afternoon
among the partridges. How could it be expected that he should think
differently when he had seen his mother and sisters feasting at the
Mayoral ball one night, and cutting the Mayor the next day when they met
him in the street?

It was not a Mayoress of Mallingham, but of a much more important
municipality--one, in fact, of so great importance as to have a Lord
Mayor and a Lady Mayoress--who had the privilege of entertaining a
certain elderly offshoot of the Royal Family upon the occasion of the
laying of the foundation-stone of a new hospital in the town. This
particular minor Royalty is well known (in certain circles) for her
ample appreciation of the dignity of her exalted position, and, like all
such ladies, she is gracious in proportion to such dust of the earth as
Mayoresses and Presidents of Colleges and Chairmen of Hospital
Boards; and she made herself so pleasant to the Lady Mayoress who
was entertaining her, that the latter determined to keep up the
acquaintance, so she made it a point to pay her a visit in her private
capacity. She drove up the stately avenue to the mansion, and inquired
if Her Royal Highness were at home, just as if Her Royal Highness
had been the wife of the vicar. She was admitted--as far as a certain
room--and after an interval of long waiting there entered, not Her
Royal Highness, but a stranger, a member of the "Household" of the minor
Royalty, and they had a chilly chat together.

And the friendship so auspiciously begun at the opening of the municipal
hospital made no advance beyond this interview, though it is understood
that the lady of the Household was as polite as if she were Her Royal
Highness herself.




III.--MISS LATIMER'S MARRIAGE LINES

There is nothing that the best set in Mallingham so resent as
pretentiousness, or the semblance of pretentiousness, on the part of any
one who does not belong to the best set. A few years ago a Mrs. Latimer,
who lives in a delightful old house close to our village of Thurswell
and is a widow, married one of her two pretty and accomplished daughters
to a young man who was beginning to make a name for himself at the Bar.
He had been at Uppingham and Oxford, and was altogether the sort of
person by whose side the most fastidious young woman would not shrink
from meeting her enemy in the Gate. The wedding was made an event of
more than usual importance, for the girl and her mother were greatly
liked, and on the mother's side were connections of actual county rank.
The list of names in the county newspaper of the wedding guests and
of the numerous presents was an imposing one: among the former was the
widow of a Baronet, a County Court Judge, a Major-General (retired),
and a Master of Hounds; and among the latter, a diamond and sapphire
necklace (the gift of the bridegroom), a cheque (from the bride's
uncle), a silver-mounted dressing-bag (from the bride's sister), and the
usual silver-backed brushes, button-hooks, shoe-lifters, blotters, and
nondescript articles. When the late Dr. Schliemann exhibited the result
of his excavations at the supposed site of Troy, there were to be seen
several articles to which no use could possibly be assigned. No one
seemed to perceive that these must have been wedding presents.

It was, however, generally allowed that the wedding had been a very
pretty one, that the bride had looked her best, and that the bridegroom
appeared a good fellow; and in addition to the column and a half
devoted to the affair by a generous newspaper, there appeared the usual
announcement: Weston--Latimer.--On the 2nd inst., at Thurswell Church, by
the Rev. Theophilas Watson, B.A.Oxon, Vicar of Thurswell, late Incumbent
of St. Michael and All Angels, Bardswell, and Rural Dean, assisted
by the Rev. Anselm Sigurd Mott, M. A., late Fellow of King's College,
London, and Senior Curate of St. James the Less, Brindlington,
William Henry, eldest son of the late John Weston of King's Elms,
Leicestershire, to Ida Evelyn, elder daughter of the late George
Cruikshank Latimer, of Todderwell, and Susan Prescott Latimer, of Grange
Lodge, Thurswell.

This was the advertised notice in the _Telegraph_, as well as in the
local paper, on the day after the wedding.

Three or four days later, however, there appeared, in the
corresponding column of the _Post_, an amended version of the same
announcement--Weston--Latimer.--On the 2nd inst., at Thurswell Parish
Church, William Henry Weston, eldest son of the late John Weston,
Attorney's Clerk, King's Elms, Leicestershire, to Ida, daughter of the
late George C. Latimer, Farmer, Todderwell.

This piece of feline malevolence was easily traced to a lady with a
highly marriageable daughter who had been posing for several years as
one of the guardians of "exclusiveness" of Mallingham. An adroit lady
had only to pay her a visit, ostensibly to call her attention to the
delightful announcement--"the cleverest thing that had ever been done,"
she called it--to invite a return of confidence, and, with sparkling
eyes, the perpetrator accepted the credit of thinking out the scheme for
the humiliation of her neighbour for her arrogance in making so much of
the wedding.

And the most melancholy part of the contemptible affair was that the
greater number of the best set actually talked over it as a properly
administered blow to the Latimers, and chuckled over it for many days.

But the very next year Mrs. Latimer's other daughter got married to the
heir to a baronetcy; the wedding took place in St. George's, Hanover
Square, and the _Post_ gave an account of it to the extent of half a
column, and the _Mirror_ gave photographs of the bride and bridegroom.

It would scarcely be believed, except by some one acquainted with the
best society at Mallingham, that upon this occasion the lady who had
displayed her skill in snubbing the Latimers sent a two-guinea present
to the bride. It was understood that the list of presents would appear
in the _Post;_ but when this list appeared the name of the donor of this
special gift was absent from it: the two-guinea gift had been promptly
returned by the mother of the bride.

And here is another touch: the valuable cake basket was returned with a
heavy dinge in one place, which the jeweller affirms was not there
when he packed it in tissue paper and shavings in its box with the
card bearing the inscription: "To dear Constance, with best wishes
from--------" That is why he refused to take it back.

It was the son of this lady whose generosity was so spurned who, on
leaving the rather second-class public school at which he received a
sort of education, gravely said to another boy from Mallingham who had
also just been finished--

"I suppose I'll often see you at Mallingham, old chap, as we are both
living there, and I'm sure that I should be very glad to have a
chat with you now and then; but, of course, you won't expect me to
acknowledge you if I am walking with my mother or sister."

"Why not?" asked the other boy.

"Oh, my dear fellow, can't you see that it would never do?" said the
first. "You know that your people are not in our set. You can't expect
that because we happen to have been three years in the same house,
we are in the same social position at home. But, as you know, there's
nothing of the snob about me, and any time that we meet in one of the
side streets, and even at the unfashionable end of High Street, I'll
certainly nod to you. But that's the farthest that I can be expected to
go."

The other boy certainly expected him to go very much farther even than
the unfashionable end of the High Street, and ventured to delimitate the
boundaries of the place, and to say a word or two respecting its climate
and the fitness of his companions and all his family for a permanent
residence there. Being a biggish lad, and enjoying a reputation for
being opposed to peace at any price, he could express his inmost
feelings without being deterred by any inconvenient reprisals.

The other did not even respond to his exuberance upon this occasion. He
sulked in the corner of the railway carriage where the conversation took
place, and he has been sulking ever since.




IV.--THE ENTERPRISE OF MALLINGHAM

It was a gentleman who travelled in the latest styles in soft goods who
was heard to affirm that Mallingham was not a town: it was a dormitory.

He doubtless spoke from the horizon line of soft goods, having in his
eye certain of those firms who still do business in the concave side of
ancient bay windows, and have not yet been lured on to fortnightly cheap
sales behind a sheet of plate-glass. A commercial traveller takes some
time to recover his selfrespect after importuning a possible client in
the con-cavity of an eighteenth-century window of what was once a dainty
parlour, but is now a dingy shop.

[Illustration: 0139]

But, as a matter of fact, there is a deep and pellucid well of
enterprise in the centre of commercial circles in Mallingham, and it
only wants an occasional stir to irrigate the dead levels of the town.
For instance, there is published by a stationer in the High Street
the _Mallingham Almanac_, an annual work which gives a large amount
of interesting information valuable to many persons in an agricultural
district, such as the list of fair days in all the villages in the
county, the hours of the rising and setting of the sun (of undoubted
interest to farmers), the changes of the moon (also very important to
have noted down to the very second), the equation of time from day to
day (without which we could hardly get on at all), the time of high
water at London Bridge, and the variation of the compass (indispensable
to agriculturists). A graver note is, however, sounded in the pages
devoted to prophecy, after the style of the ever veracious Francis
Moore, where readers, born when Mercury was in the Fourth House, are
warned against eating uncooked horse-chestnuts on a Friday, and the
general public are told that as, in a certain month, Mars and Neptune
are in opposition--perhaps it should be apposition--news will be
published regarding the German Emperor.

Then there are pages given over wholly to poetry, like Ephraim and his
idols.

The spirit of enterprise which flutters--I am afraid that I referred to
it in an earlier paragraph in a way that suggested water which really
does not flutter,--as a moth round a flame, round a good advertising
medium in Mallingham, is shown by the pages of business cards scattered
throughout the sheets of this almanac.

In his Address to his Subscribers which prefaces the last issue, the
publisher, who is also the editor, recognises in a handsome way
the support which he has received from his numerous advertisers
and expresses the earnest hope that they may all, individually and
collectively, find that their business will rapidly increase as a reward
for their enterprise.

On the opposite page may be read the business cards of three
undertakers.

Mallingham is certainly not a dormitory so far as the possibilities of
trade are concerned. It may safely be said that every business house
will undertake undertaking in all its branches and the removal of
furniture. No matter how small may be the apparent connection between
the business professed on the shop sign and the undertaking industry or
the removal industry, you will find on inquiry the utmost willingness
expressed to meet your wishes in either direction.

The qualification of a dealer in antiques to carry out such a contract
is not immediately apparent, but it is certainly more apparent than that
of an auctioneer; at least, if you need to be buried, it is not to an
auctioneer you will go in the first instance. To be sure, if you read
_Othello_ carefully you will find that there is quite an intimate
connection between "removals" and undertaking; but, as a rule, for
business purposes each of the two trades is regarded as distinct from
the other.

But in Mallingham you not only find them amalgamated, but both are run
(decorously) in association with hardware, upholstery, blind-making,
carpetbeating, life and fire assurance (not at all so extraordinary this
last named), crockery, and soft goods. It is rumoured that the largest
business in the "lines" referred to is in the hands of a rag and bone
merchant and a dyer.

It is pleasant to be able to record that no one has yet been known to
accept the suggestion of the pun in regard to the aptitude of the dyer
in such a connection, and it is certain that Shakespeare himself would
not have been able to resist the temptation. But Shakespeare has said
many things that no one in Mallingham would care to invent or even to
repeat.

One of the most notable instances of the professional enterprise of
Mallingham was told to me by its victim. He was a clergyman, and the
curate of one of the parishes. Now there are curates who are as fully
qualified to discharge the duties of their calling as is a Rector,
or even a Rural Dean: some of those whom we find in the country have
"walked the hospitals," so to speak, having been for years labouring in
the slums of a large town; but some are what might be termed only "first
aid" men, and it was a "first aid" curate who, on taking up his duties
in Mallingham, set about a zealous house-to-house visitation, being
determined to become personally acquainted with every member of his
flock.

He had already made some headway in the course he had mapped out for
himself, and was becoming greatly liked for his sociability before he
had reached the letter R in his visiting list, at the head of which
was the name of Mr. Walter Ritchie, the dentist, a gentleman who, in
addition to enjoying an excellent practice as a destructive rather than
a constructive artist, was a good Churchman. It was between the hours of
twelve and one that the zealous curate found it convenient to call upon
him, and he was promptly shown into the waiting-room, where there was an
elderly lady with a slightly swollen face studying the pages of a very
soiled _Graphic_ of three weeks old. Of her company he was, however,
bereft within the space of a few minutes, and the _Graphic_ was
available for his entertainment for the next quarter of an hour. Then
the maid returned and said that Mr. Ritchie would see him now, and he
followed her across the passage and was shown into the usual operating
room of the second-class practitioner of the country town.

Mr. Ritchie greeted him warmly and so volubly as saved the clergyman
the need for introducing any of the professional inanities which are
supposed to smooth the way to an honourable _rapprochement_ be-ween a
pastor and an unknown member of his pastorate. The parson had not really
a word to say when Mr. Ritchie got upon the topic of teeth, and warned
his visitor that he must be very careful in his use of the Mallingham
water until he should get accustomed to it. It had an injurious effect
upon the natural enamel of the teeth of the lower jaw, he said.

"I will explain to you what I mean, if you will kindly sit here," he
added, pointing to the iron-framed chair, the shape of which expresses
the most excruciating comfort to a dentist's clientele. The curate,
wishing to be all things to all men, though he had no intention of being
a dentist's "example," smiled and seated himself. In an instant Mr.
Ritchie had him in his power; bending over him, he gently scraped away
some of the "enamel" from one of his front teeth and, exhibiting a speck
on the end of the steel scraper, explained the chemical changes which
an unguarded use of the chalky water of the town supply would have upon
that substance, though it made no difference to the secretions of the
glands of the upper jaw.

This was very interesting and civil, if somewhat "shoppy," of Mr.
Ritchie, the clergyman thought, and once more opened his mouth to allow
of the dentist's obtaining a sample of the alkaline deposit to which he
had alluded. But the moment his jaws were apart Mr. Ritchie made a sound
as of a sudden indrawing of his breath.

"Ha, what have we here?" he cried. "Nasty, nasty! but not too far
gone--no, I sincerely hope, not too far gone. One moment." He had
inserted a little shield-shaped mirror in the curate's mouth and was
pressing it gently against an upper tooth. "Ah yes, as I thought--a
little stuffing will save it. Nerve exposed. You are quite right to come
to me at once. A stitch in time, you know. It will hardly require any
drilling--only at the rough edges."

The clergyman was not the man to protest against Mr. Ritchie's
civilities. He admitted that the tooth had given him some trouble the
previous year, but he had not thought it worth consulting a dentist
about.

"That's the mistake that people make," said Mr. Ritchie mournfully.
"They usually associate a visit to their dentist with some
atrocity--some moments of agony--that was the result of the old
tradition, dating back to John Leech's days. Of course, in those dark
ages dentists did not exist, whereas now---- I think I would do well to
do a little crown work between the tooth I am stopping and the next: the
gap between the two is certain to work mischief before many months are
over, and the back of the nearest molar has become so worn through the
pressure of that overgrown one below it that, if not checked in time, it
will break off with you some fine day. I'm glad that you came to me
to-day. I will make a new man of you."

He had the little ingenious emery drill working away before the
clergyman remembered that he had not come to pay a professional visit
to the dentist--that is to say, he had meant that his visit should be
a professional one so far as his own profession went, but not that it
should be a professional one so far as the profession of the other man
went. But it seemed to him that the dentist was fast approaching the
moment when he, the dentist, would not be amenable to the _convenances_
of the parochial visit, but would become completely absorbed in the
_nuances_ of dental science which every revolution of the emery drill
seemed to be revealing. He could say nothing. He was in an unaccustomed
posture for speech. He was lying in the steely embrace of that highly
nickelised chair, with his face looking up to the ceiling--exactly the
reverse of the attitude in which he felt so fluent every Sunday evening.
With his head bending over the top of his pulpit, he felt that he was
equal to explaining everything in heaven above or the earth beneath; but
sprawling back, with his eyes on the ceiling, and a thing whizzing like
a cockchafer in his mouth, he was incapable of protest, even when he
had recovered himself sufficiently to feel that a protest might be
judicious, if not actually effective.

He submitted.

For the next four weeks he was, off and on, in the hands of Mr. Ritchie.
It seemed as he went on that he had not a really sound tooth in his
head, though he told me, almost tearfully, that previously he had always
prided himself on his excellent teeth.

"I think Mr. Ritchie went too far in the end," he added, recapitulating
the main incidents of his indictment of the dentist. "I dare say a
couple of my molars were showing signs of wear and tear, and so were all
the better for being filled in properly; and it is quite likely that
the gulf between the other two was the better for being bridged
over--possibly a flake or two needed to be ground away from one of the
grinders at the back--but I am sure that the time occupied in correcting
some of the other irregularities which he perceived, but which had never
caused me a moment's inconvenience, might have been better spent. I
often thought so; but I said nothing until he calmly advised me to have
six of my upper jaw painlessly extracted, apparently for no other reason
than to show me how the new system of injecting cocaine, or something,
worked, and that he could do what he called 'crown work' with the best
dentists at Brindlington--then I thought it time to speak out, and I did
speak out."

"And what did you say to him?" I inquired, for I longed to be put in
touch with the phraseology of a "first aid" parson when speaking out.

"I didn't spare him: I told him just what I thought of him."

"And what did that amount to? Nothing grossly offensive, I hope."

"I wasn't careful of my words; I did not weigh them. If they sounded
offensive to him I cannot help it."

"What did you say to him, as nearly as you can recollect? I'm rather a
connoisseur of language and I may be able to relieve your mind, if you
have any uneasiness on the subject of the man's feelings when you had
done with him. What did you say to him?"

"I told him plainly that I thought he had gone too far; and now, looking
at the whole transaction from a purely impersonal standpoint, I am not
disposed to withdraw a single word of what I said. He did go too far--I
honestly believe it. You will understand that it is not easy for one to
take up an attitude of complete detachment in considering a matter such
as this in all its bearings; but I think that I have disciplined myself
sufficiently to be able to consider it in an unprejudiced spirit, and
really I do believe that he went too far."

"If he did, you certainly did not," said I. "Has he sent you in his
bill?"

"It is not his bill that matters--it only comes to £5, 11s. 6d. What
I objected to was his implication that I had not a sound tooth in my
head--I that have been accustomed during the past five years to crack
nuts--not mere filberts, mind, but the sort that come from Brazil--at
all the school feasts without the need for crackers! Just think of it!
Oh yes, he certainly went too far."

I agreed with him; I had no idea that there was so much enterprise in
all Mallingham.

The general idea that prevails in regard to Mallingham is that it has
remained stagnant--except for its aspirations after plate-glass--during
the past four or five hundred years of its existence. A dog of some sort
lies asleep at midday under almost every shop window, and cats of all
sorts may be seen crossing the High Street at almost any hour. That is
how it comes that the town seems so charming to visitors, and to those
of its inhabitants who are not engaged in business.

This being so, I was disposed to laugh at the sly humour of a man and
his wife--they were Russian nobles who motored across from Brindlington
to lunch with us at Thurswell--who said they had enjoyed the drive
exceedingly, until they had come to Mallingham. "A horrid, rowdy place,
like the East End of London on Saturday night," were the exact words
those visitors employed, and I had actually begun to laugh at their
ironical humour when I saw that they were meant to be in earnest. For
some time I was in a state of perplexity; but then the truth suddenly
flashed upon me: it was the day of the Mallingham Races--one of the
three days of the year when the dogs are not allowed to sleep in the
streets and when the cats remain indoors, when the High Street is for
a full hour after the arrival of the train crowded with all that it
disgorges, and when there is a stream of vehicles carrying to the
picturesque racecourse on the Downs the usual supporters of the turf,
with redfaced bookmakers and their "pitches," as objectionable a crew as
may be encountered in the streets of any country town at any season.

It was clear that my friends had reached the High Street of Mallingham
a few minutes after the arrival of the train, and not being aware of the
exceptional circumstances which had galvanised the place into life for
a brief twenty minutes, they had assumed that this was the normal aspect
of the town! I did my best to remove from Mallingham the reproach of
being the great centre of bustling life that it had seemed to these
strangers; but I could see that I did not altogether succeed in
convincing them that, except for four days out of the year, nothing
happens in Mallingham--three days of races and one night of loyal
revelry--for even the holding of the Assizes three times a year does not
cause the town to awake from its immemorial repose. The trumpets sound
as the judge drives up to the County Hall with a mounted escort, and the
shopkeepers come to their doors and glance down the street; the sleeping
dogs jump up and begin to bark in a half-hearted way, but settle
themselves comfortably down again before the last note of the fanfare
has passed away, and, except for an occasional glimpse of a man in a wig
crossing the street to the hotel, the Assize week passes much the same
as any other week of the uneventful year. Three hundred years have
passed since anything happened in Mallingham, and then it was nothing
worth talking about. One must go back seven hundred years to find the
town the centre of an historical incident of importance.

But the rumour is that Messrs. Williamson & Rubble, drapers and
outfitters, are about to have a new plate-glass front made for both
their shops, with convex corners and roll-up shutters; so Mallingham
marches onward from century to century--slowly.
