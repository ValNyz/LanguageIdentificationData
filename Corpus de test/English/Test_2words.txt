Ay neighbours

affirmed and 
did not 
flinch from 
his statement 
in spite 
of the 
incredulous murmur 
that arose 
from the 
bench nearest 
the door 
which was 
immediately suppressed 
by the 
landlord who 
was apprehensive 
of a 
riot Thurswell

you may 
look in

any mention 
of that 
mushroom town

even of

to the

a blow 
to Brindlington

are several 
other villages 
within a 
mile or 
so of

inhabitants of 
some are 
infatuated enough 
to believe 
that they 
are on 
a social 
as well 
as a 
commercial level 
with the 
people of 
Thurswell singular 
hallucination caused 
a good 
deal of 
friction on 
all sides 
in years 
gone by 
and the 
rapprochement that 
was eventually 
brought about 
between and 
its neighbours 
by the 
thoughtfulness of 
a who 
preached a 
sermon on 
the vision 
of and 
enjoined upon 
his hearers 
to remember 
that even 
though people 
have not 
been born 
in they 
are still 
creatures was 
a purely 
sentimental one 
and did 
not last 
Some years 
ago an 
article appeared 
in the 
from the 
pen of 
an eminent 
archaeologist affirming 
that must 
originally have 
been so 
that the 
place dated 
back to 
the time 
of the 
worship of 
the god 
but while 
this evidence 
of its 
antiquity was 
received by 
some of 
us with 
enthusiasmhaving been 
a resident 
in the 
village for 
a whole 
year was 
naturally an 
ardent was 
when reproduced 
in the 
Nethershire generally 
regarded as 
the invention 
of some 
one anxious 
to give 
the enemies 
of the 
village some 
ground for 
their animosity 
toward it 
the suggestion 
that it 
had a 
heathen origin 
was not 
one it 
was felt 
to which 
its people 
could tamely 
submit was 
some talk 
of a 
public meeting 
to protest 
against the 
conclusions come 
to by 
the archaeologist 
and the 
was considered 
in some 
quarters to 
be but 
a halfhearted 
champion of 
the when 
he refused 
to lend 
the schoolhousesixty 
people could 
be crowded 
into itfor 
this purpose 
his argument 
that the 
more heathen 
had been 
in the 
past the 
more marked 
should be 
its display 
of the 
virtue of 
charity in 
the present 
being criticised 
as savouring 
of months

was the 
leading topic 
of the

up a

misprint in

IITHE More 
recently still 
another busybody 
endeavoured to 
deprive the 
village of 
the reputation 
which it 
had long 
enjoyed as 
the centre 
of longevity 
it would 
be impossible 
for any 
one to 
study the 
dates on 
the tombstones 
in the 
churchyard without 
noticing how 
great was 
the number 
of centenarians 
who died 
within the 
first fifty 
years of 
the nineteenth 
century in 
the parish 
of were 
apparently eighteen 
men and 
fourteen women 
interred after 
passing their 
hundredth year 
indeed one 
woman was 
recorded to 
have reached 
her hundred 
and twentyseventh 
year which 
is a 
good age 
for a 
woman people 
were naturally 
very proud 
of the 
constant references 
made in 
print to 
their longevity 
but one 
day there 
came down 
to the 
village a 
member of 
the Statistical 
and after 
busying himself 
among the 
musty parish 
registers for 
a month 
he announced 
his discovery 
that in 
every case 
but one 
the date 
of the 
birth of 
the alleged 
centenarians was 
the date 
of the 
birth of 
their parents 
investigator had 
noticed that 
all the 
alleged centenarians 
had departed 
this life 
during the 
rectorship of 
the and 
centenarianism had 
always been 
his fad 
had preached 
sermon after 
sermon on 
and other 
distinguished multicentenarians 
and he 
spent his 
time travelling 
about the 
country in 
search of 
evidence in 
confirmation of 
the theory 
that Methuselah 
though somewhat 
beyond the 
average in 
respect of 
age might 
yet have 
been exceeded 
on his 
own ground 
by many 
people living 
in the 
country districts 
of was 
easier the 
investigator tried 
to show 
than for 
a clergyman 
in charge 
of the 
registers who 
had such 
a hobby 
to assume 
when any 
very old 
man or 
woman died 
in his 
parish that 
he or 
she actually 
was twenty 
years or 
so older 
and as 
the Christian 
names were 
nearly always 
hereditary in 
nine cases 
out of 
ten he 
accepted the 
registry of 
the birth 
of the 
father as 
that of 
the lately 
deceased man 
and the 
date of 
the birth 
of the 
mother in 
regard to 
the aged 
woman the 
result being 
a series 
of the 
most interesting 
inscriptions I 
must confess 
that myself 
felt that 
had a 
personal grievance 
against this 
busybody statistician 
is nothing 
so comforting 
to the 
middleaged as 
a stroll 
through a 
cemetery of 
centenarians and 
had the 
most uncharitable 
feelings against 
the person 
who could 
make such 
an attempt 
to deprive 
me of 
the pleasant 
hope of 
living another 
sixty or 
seventy years 
But while 
we were 
still talking 
about the 
danger of 
permitting strangers 
to have 
access to 
the registers 
was told 
one morning 
that a 
man who 
had once 
been the 
gardener at 
the place 
which had 
just acquired 
would like 
to see 
me had 
had already 
some traffic 
with the 
superannuated gardener 
of my 
predecessor and 
so was 
now surprised 
to find 
myself face 
to face 
with quite 
a different 
person You 
were not 
the gardener 
here said 
saw him 
his name 
is Craggs 
and he 
still lives 
in the 
hollow Oh 
ay we 
called him 
knew his 
father replied 
my visitor 
was only 
here a 
matter of 
sixandthirty years 
I was 
superann'ated to 
make way 
for him 
we called 
him and 
was curious 
to see 
how things 
had come 
on in 
the garden 
of late 
You were 
superannuated thirtysix 
years ago 
said age 
are you 
now I'm 
ninetyeight sir 
he replied 
with a 
smirk I 
showed him 
round the 
garden said 
he could 
see that 
the things 
he had 
planted had 
grown summut 
and walked 
through the 
churchyard the 
next with 
the greatest 
complacency When 
told the 
that my 
experience of 
this grand 
old gardener 
tended to 
make me 
take the 
side of 
and the 
neighbourhood against 
scientific investigation 
in regard 
to longevity 
he assured 
me that 
if paid 
a visit 
to a 
certain elderly 
lady who 
lived with 
a middleaged 
granddaughter in 
a cottage 
on the 
road to 
should find 
ample confirmation 
of the 
faith for 
which had 
a leaning 
lady's name 
was he 
said and 
she really 
was he 
thought a 
genuine centenarian 
for she 
had a 
vivid recollection 
of events 
which had 
happened quite 
ninety years 
ago and 
unlike most 
reputed centenarians 
she remembered 
many details 
of the 
historical incidents 
that had 
taken place 
in her 
young days 
she was 
a most 
intelligent person 
altogether and 
had evidently 
been at 
one time 
a great 
reader though 
latterly her 
eyesight had 
shown signs 
of failing 
I made 
up my 
mind to 
pay a 
visit to 
this and 
thought that 
perhaps might 
get material 
for a 
letter to 
the that 
should not 
leave the 
scientific investigator 
a leg 
to stand 
on month 
however elapsed 
before carried 
out my 
intention though 
the thought 
this was 
not a 
case for 
procrastination when 
a lady 
is anything 
over a 
hundred her 
hold upon 
life shows 
a tendency 
to relax 
he said 
for even 
the most 
notorious centenarians 
cannot be 
expected to 
live for 
ever when 
managed to 
make my 
call must 
confess that 
was amply 
repaid for 
the time 
spent in 
the company 
of I 
found her 
sitting in 
her chair 
in what 
is called 
the chimney 
corner when 
it exists 
in its 
original condition 
in a 
cottage but 
is termed 
the ingle 
nook in 
those red 
brick imitation 
cottages which 
are being 
flung about 
the country 
by those 
architects who 
concern themselves 
in the 
development of 
estates saw 
at once 
that such 
a figure 
would be 
out of 
place anywhere 
except in 
the chimney 
corner of 
a cottage 
kitchen with 
immovable windows 
but a 
practicable iron 
crane for 
the swinging 
of pots 
over the 
hearth fire 
atmospherethanks to 
the immobile 
casementswas also 
all that 
it should 
be it 
was congenially 
centenarian perceived 
in a 
moment had 
a pleasant 
pungency of 
old bacon 
but though 
looked about 
for a 
genuine flitch 
maturing in 
the smoke 
failed to 
see onestill 
the nail 
on which 
it should 
be hanging 
was there 
all right 
The old 
woman was 
quite alert 
was nothing 
of the 
wheezy gammer 
about her 
one ear 
was slightly 
deaf she 
told me 
when had 
been introduced 
by her 
granddaughtera woman 
certainly over 
fifty smiled 
referring to 
her one 
infirmity and 
when she 
smiled the 
parchment of 
her face 
became like 
the surface 
of the 
most ancient 
palimpsest it 
was seamed 
by a 
thousand of 
the finest 
lines and 
made me 
feel that 
I was 
looking at 
an original 
etching by 
or trial 
proof not 
evenly bitten 
in places 
and the 
cap she 
wore added 
to the 
illusion She 
was could 
see what 
might be 
called a 
professional centenarian 
and so 
might retain 
some of 
those prejudices 
which existed 
long ago 
against talking 
shop and 
therefore refrained 
from referring 
in any 
way to 
her age 
felt sure 
that when 
the right 
moment came 
she would 
give me 
an opening 
and found 
that had 
not misjudged 
her had 
scarcely told 
her how 
greatly we 
all liked 
our house 
before she 
gratified me 
by a 
reminiscence of 
the antepenultimate 
owner he 
had died 
happen to 
know thirtyeight 
years ago 
and remembered 
the morning 
he first 
rode his 
black horse 
to houndsthat 
was the 
year before 
he married 
and his 
son was 
now a 
majorgeneral long 
time ago 
remarked and 
she smiled 
the patronising 
smile of 
the professional 
at the 
feeble effort 
of an 
incompetent amateur 
ago no 
only a 
bit over 
sixty yearsmaybe 
seventy difference 
between sixty 
and seventy 
years ago 
was in 
her eyes 
not worth 
taking any 
account of 
treatment of 
this reminiscence 
gave me 
warning of 
what she 
could do 
when she 
had her 
second wind 
and got 
into her 
stride You 
must have 
a great 
memory remarked 
there much 
stir in 
this neighbourhood 
when got 
married heard 
something about 
a big 
bonfire on 
'Twere no 
more'n a 
lucifer match 
in compare 
with the 
flare up 
after Waterloo 
was her 
complacent reply 
and felt 
as if 
had just 
had an 
audacious pawn 
taken by 
my opponent's 
lost three 
fine youngsters 
at was 
him with 
the red 
hair The 
one they 
used to 
call suggested 
She brightened 
up The 
very sameCarrots 
they called 
him sure 
enough she 
said nodding 
But you 
couldn't have 
knowed'un you're 
no more'n 
a stripling 
as yet 
Doan't you 
list to 
all that 
you hear 
from them

theirselves ancient 
old venerables 
there's not 
a one 
of'un that's 
truthfully oldI'm 
the only 
one take 
my word 
for it 
sir I 
gave her 
to understand 
hope by 
my confidential 
smile and 
shake of 
the head 
that was 
aware of 
the many 
fraudulent claims 
to longevity 
advanced by 
some of 
our friends 
about Age 
is an 
empty thing 
without a 
memory remarked 
what a 
memory you 
have shouldn't 
wonder if 
you recollected 
the news 
of victory 
at arriving 
in no 
that was 
too long 
ago even 
for you 
She bridled 
up in 
a moment 
Too long

if you

remember seeing

the rest 
sa'wun sure 
And wonder 
if you 
ever chanced 
to see 
her Never 
sirnever always 
the sorrow 
o' my 
life that 
the day 
she passed 
through where 
was living 
with my 
grandaunt Marthaher 
that was 
named afterI 
had been 
sent with 
a basket 
o' three 
dozen eggsone 
dozen of'em 
turkeysto the 
big house 
and her 
ladyship not 
being at 
home had 
to wait 
the best 
part of 
a whole 
hour and 
by the 
time got 
back the 
had driven 
away so 
missed the 
chance o' 
my life 
for being 
since my 
early years 
noteworthy for 
speaking the 
truth to 
a hairsbreadth 
couldn't bring 
myself to 
say that 
had seen 
a royal 
person when 
hadn't what 
can say 
is that 
I on'y 
missed seeing 
of her 
by twenty 
minutes more 
or less 
I began 
to feel 
that might 
be overwhelmed 
if were 
borne much 
farther in 
the current 
of the 
pellucid stream 
of veracity 
so rose 
and thanked 
the good 
woman for 
her courtesy 
and expressed 
the hope 
that the 
efforts she 
had made 
on my 
behalf to 
be rigidly 
accurate had 
not fatigued 
her She 
assured me 
that all 
she had 
said was 
nothing to 
what she 
could say 
if had 
a mind 
to listen 
to her 
When acknowledged 
to the 
that the 
memory of 
had surpassed 
my most 
sanguine hopes 
he was 
greatly delighted 
thought it 
well however 
to neglect 
the opportunity 
he gave 
me of 
going into 
the details 
of her 
interesting recollections 
we dropped 
the subject 
he said 
what a 
pity it 
was that 
an historian 
of the 
nineteenth century 
could not 
avail himself 
of the 
services of 
to keep 
him straight 
on some 
points that 
might be 
pronounced of 
a contentious 
nature Not 
many days 
after my 
interesting interview 
with the 
professional centenarian 
the decease 
of an 
unobtrusive amateur 
was notified 
to me 
came about 
through the 
temporary disorganisation 
of our 
bread service 
which learned 
was due 
to the 
sudden death 
of the 
baker's mother 
his shop 
a week 
or two 
later ventured 
to say 
a word 
of conventional 
condolence to 
him and 
this was 
responded to 
by him 
with a 
mournful volubility 
that made 
me feel 
as if 
had just 
attended a 
funeral oration 
or an 
inefficient reading 
of It 
was a 
terrible blow 
to him 
he saida 
cruel blow 
and he 
went on 
to suggest 
that it 
was such 
an apparently 
gratuitous stroke 
that it 
made even 
the most 
orthodox man 
doubt the 
existence of 
mercy in 
the that 
had inflicted 
it No 
doubt no 
doubt acquiesced 
after all 
we must 
all die 
some day 
and your 
good mother 
could scarcely 
be said 
to have 
been cut 
off long 
before she 
had reached 
the allotted 
span know 
you can 
hardly call 
yourself a 
young man 
still He 
shook his 
head as 
if to 
hint that 
he had 
heard this 
sort of 
thing before 
think it 
very probable 
that he 
had know 
that had 
more than 
once thought 
that there 
was no 
occasion for 
him to 
suggest so 
much so 
boldly asked 
him what 
age his 
mother had 
reached He 
shook his 
head not 
laterally this 
time but 
longitudinally and 
distributing the 
flies more 
evenly over 
a plate 
of jam 
tarts with 
a mournful 
whisk of 
his feather 
duster he 
replied She 
was a 
hundred and 
four last 
sir I 
turned right 
about and 
left him 
alone with 
his irreparable 
grief III 
On the 
subject of 
age may 
say that 
it has 
always seemed 
to me 
that it 
is the 
aim of 
most people 
to appear 
as young 
as possibleand 
perhaps even 
more sofor 
as long 
as possibleand 
perhaps even 
longer but 
then it 
seems gradually 
to dawn 
upon them 
that there 
may be 
as much 
distinction attached 
to age 
as to 
youth and 
those who 
have been 
trying to 
pass themselves 
off as 
much younger 
than they 
really are 
turn their 
attention in 
the other 
direction and 
endeavour to 
make themselves 
out to 
be much 
older than 
the number 
of their 
years is 
of course 
chiefly in 
the cottages 
that the 
real veterans 
are to 
be foundold 
men and 
women who 
take a 
proper pride 
in having 
reached a 
great if 
somewhat indefinite 
age and 
in holding 
in contempt 
the efforts 
of a 
neighbour to 
rival them 
in this 
way of 
the peculiarities 
of these 
good folk 
is to 
become hilarious 
over the 
news of 
the death 
of some 
contemporary I 
have seen 
ancient men 
chuckle at 
the notion 
of their 
having survived 
some neighbour 
who they 
averred with 
great emphasis 
was much 
their junior 
idea seems 
to strike 
them as 
being highly 
humorous so 
perhaps it 
may be 
humour being 
so highly 
dependent upon 
the standpoint 
from which 
it is 
viewed In 
the cottages 
the conversation 
frequently turns 
upon the 
probability of 
an aged 
inmate being 
gathered unto 
his fathers 
before next 
harvest or 
if in 
autumn before 
the first 
snow and 
the utmost 
frankness characterises 
the remarks 
made on 
this subject 
in the 
presence of 
the person 
who might 
be supposed 
to be 
the most 
interested in 
the discussion 
though as 
a matter 
of fact 
he is 
as little 
interested in 
it as 
the claimant 
acknowledged he 
was in 
his trial 
after it 
had passed 
its fortieth 
day was 
fortunate enough 
to reach 
the shelter 
of a 
farm cottage 
before a 
great storm 
a few 
years ago 
and on 
a truckle 
bed in 
the warm 
side of 
the living 
room of 
the family 
there lay 
an old 
man who 
nodded to 
me and 
quavered out 
a good 
marn asked 
the woman 
who was 
peeling potatoes 
sitting on 
a stool 
if he 
was her 
father or 
her husband's 
father He's 
but don't 
you take 
any heed 
o' him 
sir he's 
dying she 
replied with 
the utmost 
cheerfulness bin 
here yestereve 
and says 
he'll be 
laid out 
afore a 
week we've 
everything handylike 
and ready 
for'un Illustration 
She pointed 
to a 
chair on 
which some 
white garments 
were neatly 
laid run 
the iron 
o'er'em afore 
settin' to 
the bit 
o' dinner 
she explained 
I glanced 
at the 
old man 
nodded his 
approval of 
her good 
housekeeping clearly 
thought that 
procrastination should 
be discountenanced 
The flashes 
of lightning 
and the 
peals of 
thunder seemed 
to me 
to be 
by no 
means extravagant 
accompaniments to 
this grim 
scene as 
it appeared 
in my 
eyes have 
certainly known 
far less 
impressive scenes 
on the 
stage thought 
worthy of 
the illumination 
of lightning 
and the 
punctuation of 
thunder claps 
This familiar 
treatment of 
the subject 
of the 
coming of 
the grim 
figure with 
the scythe 
prevails in 
every direction

a like 
experience in 
a cottage 
in another 
part of 
the country

the househe 
was a 
farm labourerwas 
about to 
emigrate to 
and was 
anxious to 
get as 
good a 
price as 
possible for 
some pieces 
of old 
china in 
his possession 
and my 
friend had 
called to 
see them 
by invitation 
He was 
brought into 
a bedroom 
where the 
plates were 
to be 
seen on 
a dresser 
and by 
way of 
making conversation 
on entering 
the room 
he asked 
the man

He then 
went on 
to talk 
about the 
china explaining 
that three

pieces had 
been brought 
by his

CHAPTER ITHE 
ON regard 
my experience 
of two 
delightful old 
people whom 
found living 
the one 
a mile 
or two 
on the 
side of 
the other 
on the 
side where 
the lives 
former is 
an old 
general who 
once commanded 
a regiment 
of and 
spent fifty 
years in 
is now 
eightythree years 
of age 
and has 
two sons 
with the 
rank of 
colonel a 
grandson who 
is a 
captain of 
and two 
who are 
lieutenants in 
the navy 
old man 
has nothing 
of the 
bristling retired 
general about 
himnot even 
the liver 
is of 
a gentle 
genial nature 
not very 
anxious to 
hear the 
latest news 
and not 
at all 
eager to 
make his 
visitors acquainted 
with his 
experiences in 
or his 
views as 
to the 
exact degree 
of decadence 
reached by 
the sarvice 
speaks in 
a low 
and an 
almost apologetic 
tone and 
is interested 
in old 
china and 
tortoiseshell teacaddies 
could never 
believe that 
this was 
the man 
whose sobriquet 
of of 
was once 
a household 
word along 
the turbulent 
northwest frontier 
or that 
he had 
been the 
most brilliant 
exponent of 
all the 
dash which 
one associates 
with the 
cavalry leader 
reputation on 
that long 
frontier was 
that of 
an equivalent 
of the 
of the 
ballad People 
had visions 
of him 
galloping by 
night at 
the head 
of his 
splendid Sikhs 
to cut 
off the 
latest fanatical 
insurrectionary from 
his supports 
and then 
sweep him 
and his 
marauders off 
the face 
of the 
earth Certainly 
no cavalry 
leader ever 
handled his 
men with 
that daring 
which he 
displayeda daring 
that would 
have deserved 
to be 
called recklessness 
had it 
once failed 
there he 
sat at 
dinner talking 
in his 
low voice 
about the 
fluted rim 
of one 
of his 
teacaddies and 
explaining how 
it was 
quite possible 
to repair 
the silver 
stringing that 
beautified the 
top fancied 
overheard him 
telling the 
person who 
sat by 
him at 
dinner about 
the native 
regimentsI felt 
sure that 
I heard 
the word 
and became 
alert the 
word that 
had caught 
was only 
teapoyhe was 
telling how 
he had 
got a 
finely cut 
glass for 
a deficient 
caddie out 
of an 
old nineteenthcentury 
mahogany teapoy 
was the 
nearest approach 
he made 
to the 
days of 
his greatness 
But noticed 
with satisfaction 
that he 
partook of 
every dish 
that was 
offered to 
himdown to 
the marmalade 
pudding dessert 
he glanced 
down the 
table and 
said that 
he thought 
he would 
have an 
apple dear 
said his 
daughter gently 
but firmly 
removing the 
dish beyond 
his reach 
know that 
you are 
not allowed 
to touch 
apples Why 
what harm 
will an 
apple do 
mejust oneonly 
one apple 
he inquired 
and there 
were tears 
in his 
voiceit had 
become a 
tremulous pipe 
the tone 
of a 
child whose 
treat had 
been unjustly 
curtailed dear 
not even 
one is 
for your 
own good 
you should 
have an 
apple if 
it agreed 
with you 
but it 
doesn't I 
want an 
appleI can't 
see what 
harm an 
apple would 
do me 
he cried 
again his 
daughter was 
firm was 
very pathetic 
to witness 
the scene 
of becoming 
plaintive at 
being denied 
a rosycheeked 
apple man 
who with 
a force 
of only 
six hundred 
sabres behind 
him had 
ridden up 
to with 
the three 
thousand rebels 
supporting him 
and demanded 
his sword 
and got 
it not 
being able 
to get 
his apple 
when he 
had asked 
for it 
nicely seemed 
to me 
to be 
a most 
pathetic figure 
pleaded for 
him as 
one pleads 
for a 
child in 
the nursery 
he had 
been a 
good boy 
and had 
eaten all 
that had 
been set 
before him 
quite nicelywhy 
might he 
not have 
an apple 
to make 
him happy 
But the 
daughter was 
inexorable told 
me that 
did not 
know her 
father while 
she did 
apple would 
be poison 
to him 
and so 
the old 
hero was 
left complaining 
with an 
occasional falsetto 
note upon 
the restrictions 
of his 
commissariat am 
pretty sure 
that there 
was no 
falsetto note 
in any 
of his 
complaints in 
regard to 
commissariat forty 
years ago 
He was 
a noble 
old warrior 
however for 
when his 
daughter had 
with the 
rest of 
the ladies 
left us 
after dinner 
he never 
put out 
a hand 
to the 
apple dish 
though there 
was no 
man at 
the table 
who would 
have interfered 
with him 
had he 
done so 
the remained 
blushing but 
not on 
account of 
any disloyalty 
on his 
part to 
the duty 
he owed 
to the 
daughter who 
had his 
welfare at 
heart IITHE 
The aged 
lady who 
lives in 
a lovely 
old moated 
house a 
few miles 
out of 
Thurswell is 
one of 
the youngest 
people ever 
met is 
the mother 
of two 
distinguished sons 
and the 
grandmother of 
a peeress 
takes an 
interest in 
everything that 
is going 
on in 
various parts 
of the 
world and 
even points 
out the 
mistakes made 
by the 
leaderwriters in 
the London 
paperssome of 
the mistakes 
she does 
so quite 
cheerfully and 
without any 
animus still 
sketches en 
plein air 
and in 
her drawings 
there is 
no suggestion 
of the 
drawingmaster of 
the early 
Victorians elderly 
person who 
could hold 
a pencil 
and whose 
moral character 
could bear 
a strict 
investigation was 
accounted competent 
to teach 
drawing in 
those days 
for drawing 
in those 
days meant 
nothing beyond 
making a 
fair copy 
of a 
lithograph of 
a cottage 
in a 
wood with 
a ladder 
leaning against 
a gable 
and a 
child sitting 
on a 
fencea possible 
successful statesman 
in the 
futurewith a 
dog below 
him never 
was so 
taught she 
told me 
she had 
always held 
out against 
the restrictions 
of the 
schoolroom of 
her young 
days and 
had never 
played either 
the or 
the of 
variations on 
she had 
been compelled 
to learn 
young lady 
in that 
era of 
young ladies 
could avoid 
acquiring at 
least the 
skeleton of 
masterpiece and 
was glad 
that this 
particular old 
lady who 
had once 
been a 
young lady 
had mastered 
it for 
it enabled 
her to 
give me 
the most 
delightful parody 
upon it 
that could 
be imagined 
Only once 
did hear 
her speak 
with bitterness 
in referring 
to any 
one but 
when she 
began upon 
this occasion 
she spoke 
not only 
bitterly but 
wrathfullycontemptuously as 
well was 
referring to 
the Napoleon 
in his 
relations with 
the unhappy 
of She 
had known 
the latter 
intimately own 
impression is 
that she 
had been 
in love 
with himand 
tears were 
in her 
eyes when 
she talked 
of how 
he had 
been betrayed 
by the 
man whom 
she called 
a contemptible 
little cad 
represented in 
her way 
of thinking 
the cordial 
agreement with 
her views 
by the 
above hear 
her talk 
of those 
tragedies of 
more than 
forty years 
ago as 
if they 
were the 
incidents of 
the day 
before yesterday 
was inspiriting 
never inquired 
what was 
her age 
but one 
afternoon when 
called upon 
her found 
that a 
birthday party 
was going 
ona double 
party for 
it was 
her birthday 
as well 
as her 
youngest grandchild's 
fully iced 
cakes with 
pink and 
white complexions 
were being 
illuminated in 
the customary 
way and 
each had 
been made 
a candelabrum 
of eight 
tapers ventured 
to suggest 
that there 
must be 
an error 
in computation 
in some 
direction it 
was the 
younger of 
the beneficiaries 
who explained 
to me 
that about 
seventy years 
or so 
ago had 
become too 
old to 
allow of 
her birthday 
cake holding 
the full 
amount of 
the candles 
to which 
she was 
entitled so 
it had 
been agreed 
that she 
should have 
only one 
candle for 
every ten 
years of 
her life 
little girl 
confided in 
me that 
she thought 
it was 
rather a 
shame to 
cheat poor 
out of 
her rights 
but of 
course there 
was no 
help for 
it any 
one could 
see that 
no cake 
could be 
made large 
enough to 
accommodate without 
undue crowding 
eightyone candles 
I looked 
at the 
sweet old 
and thought 
for some 
reason or 
other of 
the night 
of the 
first of 
the century 
when had 
stood listening 
to the 
tolling of 
the eightyone 
strokes of 
the church 
bell in 
Devonshire when 
every belfry 
in the 
kingdom announced 
the age 
of the 
good who 
had gone 
to her 
rest wondered 
This dear 
lady of 
the eightcandle 
birthday cakeof 
which by 
the bye 
she partook 
heartily and 
apparently without 
the least 
misgivinghad been 
married at 
the age 
of seventeen 
and this 
she thought 
was exactly 
the right 
age for 
a girl 
to marry 
not as 
might be 
supposed because 
it admitted 
of her 
period of 
repentance being 
so much 
the longer 
but simply 
because she 
considered grandchildren 
so interesting 
was not 
inclined to 
be tolerant 
over the 
prudent marriages 
of the 
present day 
when no 
girl is 
unreasonable enough 
to expect 
a proposal 
before she 
is twentyfive 
or from 
a man 
who is 
less than 
thirtyfive almost 
brought me 
back to 
to hear 
her express 
such opinions 
stately old 
lady mother 
as she 
appears in 
every modern 
production of 
the play 
was made 
by the 
author to 
be something 
between twentysix 
and twentyseven 
her daughter 
being some 
months under 
fourteen but 
certainly forward 
for her 
age used 
to be 
informed by 
sage critics 
of this 
drama of 
utter love 
defeated utterly 
that made 
so young 
because it 
was the 
custom in 
Italy where 
girls developed 
into womanhood 
at a 
much earlier 
age than 
in for 
a girl 
to marry 
at time 
of life 
so happens 
however that 
early marriage 
was the 
custom in 
and not 
in in 
the sixteenth 
century a 
girl was 
twelve her 
parents looked 
about for 
a promising 
husband for 
her and 
usually found 
one when 
she was 
thirteen Only 
a few 
months ago 
came upon 
an unpublished 
letter written 
in the 
beautiful hand 
of in 
response to 
the inquiry 
of an 
ambassador respecting 
a wife 
for an 
amiable young 
prince suggested 
two names 
of highly 
eligible young 
women and 
mentioned that 
one of 
them was 
twelve and 
the other 
thirteen The 
most flagrant 
example of 
unbridled centenarianism 
which have 
yet come 
across in 
the course 
of my 
investigations in 
the neighbourhood 
of Thurswell 
was that 
of a 
lady who 
had won 
quite a 
literary aureole 
for her 
silver hair 
owing to 
the accident 
of her 
being actually 
the original 
Cousin of 
years she 
had worn 
this honourable 
distinction and 
so far 
as could 
gather her 
title to 
it had 
never been 
disputed in 
the of 
the tradition 
had been 
accepted and 
she had 
been pointed 
out to 
strangers who 
doubtless looked 
at her 
with interest 
saying really 
or perfectly 
sweet I 
ventured to 
ask the 
prebendary who 
had told 
me that 
the poet 
had been 
in love 
with her 
and consequently 
greatly cut 
up when 
she married 
some one 
elseas might 
be inferred 
from some 
passages in 
the poemwhat 
was the 
present age 
of the 
lady and 
he assured 
me that 
she was 
seventyfour did 
not look 
it but 
she really 
was seventyfour 
had not 
the heart 
to point 
out that 
twentythree years 
had elapsed 
since Tennyson 
published his 
sequelSixty his 
Hall so 
that this 
must be 
at least 
a centenarian 
if she 
had not 
died as 
described in 
the sequel 
between eighty 
and ninety 
years ago

a nice 
old lady

attention and 
the ladies

the question 
of calling

be thoroughly 
threshed out

every one 
knows how 
far astray 
from the

so that 
the fact 
of the

not invariably

is the 
middleaged daughter 
of a 
previous rector 
and for 
years these 
ladies have 
assumed the 
right of 
veto in 
respect of 
the question 
of calling 
upon newcomers 
the past 
year however 
this question 
it should 
be mentioned 
has developed 
certain complications 
owing to 
the strained 
relations existing 
between the 
two ladies 
they formed 
a sort 
of vigilance 
committee to 
determine what 
should be 
done but 
since the 
breaking off 
of diplomatic 
relations between 
them the 
poor people 
who had 
previously looked 
to them 
jointly for 
guidance are 
now compelled 
to consult 
them severally 
as to 
the course 
they mean 
to pursue 
and all 
this takes 
time and 
the loss 
of time 
in the 
etiquette of 
first calls 
may be 
construed into 
actual rudeness 
by sensitive 
people That 
is how 
we stand 
at present 
and although 
many wellmeaning 
personsnot invariably 
belonging to 
clerical circleshave 
endeavoured to 
bring about 
a rapprochement 
for the 
good of 
the whole 
community between 
and hitherto 
every effort 
of the 
kind has 
failed When 
the particulars 
of the 
incident that 
brought about 
the friction 
between the 
two ladies 
are known 
it will 
easily be 
understood that 
a restoration 
of the 
status quo 
ante is 
not to 
be accomplished 
in a 
moment It 
was all 
due to 
the exceptionally 
dry summer 
who retain 
only the 
pleasantest recollections 
of that 
season of 
sunlight and 
balmy breezes 
will probably 
find reason 
to modify 
their views 
respecting it 
when they 
hear how 
it led 
to the 
shattering of 
an old 
friendship and 
incidentally to 
the complication 
of the 
most important 
social question 
that can 
come before 
such a 
community as 
is represented 
by IITHE 
The facts 
of the 
matter are 
simple enough 
in their 
way of 
the ladies 
occupies a 
small house 
of her 
own fully 
and not 
semidetached with 
a small 
patch of 
green in 
front and 
a small 
garden at 
the back 
but the 
combined needs 
of front 
and back 
are not 
considered sufficiently 
great to 
take up 
all the 
time of 
a gardener 
working six 
days in 
the week 
during the 
summer is 
enough work 
however to 
take up 
three days 
of the 
six with 
windowcleaning thrown 
in in 
slack seasons 
the conditions 
of labour 
are identical

case of 
the gardens

ladiesonly throws

the jobbing 
gardener of 
Thurswell suggested 
several years 
ago that 
he should 
divide his 
time between 
the two 
gardens and 
this plan 
to all 
appearances worked 
very satisfactorily 
in regard 
to every 
one concerned 
Illustration Only 
was aware 
of the 
trouble involved 
in keeping 
both gardens

the same 
level of

of the 
difficulty of 
preventing either 
of the 
ladies from 
seeing that 
anything in 
the garden 
of the 
other was 
getting on 
better than 
the same 
thing in 
her own 
patch might 
have been 
fancied that 
as they 
were in 
complete agreement 
respecting the 
necessity for 
a strict 
censorship upon 
the visiting 
lists of 
the neighbourhood 
as regards 
strangers there 
could not 
possibly exist 
any rivalry 
between them 
on so 
insignificant a 
matter as 
the growth 
of a 
petunia or 
the campanile 
of a 
campanula but 
knew better 
had been 
his task 
year by 
year to 
minimise to 
the one 
lady his 
success with 
the garden 
of the 
otherto say 
a word 
of disparagement 
on and 
Saturdays of 
all that 
he had 
been praising 
on and 
Wednesdays sometimes 
is stronger 
even than 
her greatest 
enemy a 
jobbing gardener 
and so 
it was 
that when 
chanced to 
pay a 
visit to 
on a 
she found 
the garden 
of the 
latter just 
recovering from 
the hand 
of attention 
on the 
Monday and 
obviously superior 
in some 
respects to 
her own 
and found 
his diplomatic 
resources quite 
unable to 
meet with 
the demand 
for an 
explanation when 
she got 
home was 
in vain 
that he 
tried to 
make her 
understand what 
she certainly 
should have 
known already 
from her 
experience of 
the ministrations 
of that 
not he 
but the 
superior soil 
and aspect 
of herbaceous 
border should 
be regarded 
accountable for 
the marvellous 
growths which 
had attracted 
her attention 
in the 
garden of 
her rival 
His and 
patron declared 
herself far 
from satisfied 
with such 
an explanation 
she ever 
shown herself 
to be 
closefisted in 
the matter 
of soil 
she inquired 
as for 
aspecthad he 
not chosen 
the aspect 
of the 
herbaceous border 
at which 
he was 
now working 
she knew 
very well 
she affirmed 
that what 
made a 
garden beautiful 
was loving 
care professed 
herself unable 
to understand 
why should 
lavish all 
his affection 
upon border 
rather than 
upon her 
own all 
that she 
could do 
was to 
judge by 
results and 
viewed from 
this basis 
it could 
not but 
be apparent 
to every 
unprejudiced observer 
that he 
had been 
giving borders 
such loving 
touches as 
he had 
never bestowed 
upon her 
own the 
flowers spoke 
for themselves 
John had 
heard of 
the of 
but he 
had never 
mastered the 
elements of 
their speech 
a matter 
of fact 
he took 
no interest 
in flowers 
or their 
habits had 
dratted them 
times without 
number for 
their failure 
to do 
all that 
the illustrated 
catalogues declared 
they would 
do and 
now he 
found reason 
to drat 
those of 
for having 
done much 
more than 
he had 
meant them 
to do 
was with 
a view 
to restore 
the balance 
of mediocrity 
between the 
gardens which 
had been 
through no 
fault of 
his disturbed 
by a 
sudden outbreak 
of Brides 
in parterre 
that he 
gave some 
extra waterings 
to verbinas 
trusting to 
convince her 
that he 
was a 
thoroughly disinterested 
operator in 
both the 
gardenswhich was 
certainly a 
fact in 
that arid 
summer the 
response of 
the verbinas 
was but 
too rapid 
and calling 
upon her 
friend and 
rival was 
shown the 
bed with 
the same 
pride that 
she had 
displayed when 
exhibiting her 
petunias She 
said nothingthe 
day was 
she perceived 
with that 
unerring intuition 
which in 
some persons 
almost takes 
the place 
of genius 
that petunias 
had been 
supplanted literally 
by verbinas 
in the 
affections of 
She spent 
the rehearsing 
an interview 
which she 
had arranged 
in her 
mind to 
have with 
when he 
should arrive 
the next 
day But 
came and 
failed to 
arrive waited 
at the 
back entrance 
to the 
garden until 
ten o'clock 
but still 
he did 
not appear 
she sent 
a messenger 
to his 
cottage to 
inquire the 
cause of 
his absence 
and were 
her days 
for his 
services and 
never once 
had he 
failed her 
could not 
guess what 
was the 
matter had 
always regarded 
him as 
a sober 
man and 
one for 
whom Monday 
morning had 
no terrors 
mystery of 
his first 
failure was 
rendered all 
the more 
unfathomable when 
the tweeny 
maid returned 
saying that 
had told 
her positive 
that had 
gone out 
to work 
as usual 
that same 
morning and 
that had 
taken it 
for granted 
that he 
was in 
garden For 
a quarter 
of an 
hour pondered 
over the 
whole incident 
and then 
she suddenly 
put on 
another hat 
discarding the 
garden specimen 
with which 
she had 
begun the 
day and 
went down 
the road 
and round 
by the 
to where 
villa was 
situated just 
beyond the 
knoll of 
elms hall 
door was 
wide open 
to the 
morning air 
and through 
the glass 
door at 
the farther 
end of 
the hall 
she distinctly 
saw standing 
on the 
edge of 
one of 
the beds 
of the 
garden with 
kneeling at 
her feet 
And this 
on a 
morning John 
had actually 
attended morning 
service in 
the church 
the day 
beforeMiss had 
seen him 
thereand yet 
on he 
had broken 
faith with 
her and 
now at 
tenthirty he 
was engaged 
in planting 
out the 
contents of 
the capacious 
basket which 
was doling 
out to 
him And 
was wearing 
her garden 
hat just 
as if 
the day 
was Thursday 
or when 
she was 
entitled to 
his services 
And had 
also been 
at church 
the previous 
day and 
had repeated 
the responses 
in her 
ordinary tone 
of voice 
and without 
faltering though 
beyond a 
doubt her 
heart had 
been full 
of this 
scheme of 
suborning a 
faithful if 
somewhat weak 
servant from 
his allegiance 
to the 
mistress who 
had an 
undisputed claim 
to his 
services the 
next day 
Without a 
moment's hesitation 
passed into 
the hall 
opened the 
glass door 
beyond and 
stood beside 
the guilty 
pair before 
either of 
them was 
aware of 
her presence 
saw that 
the man 
was planting 
astersthe finest 
aster cuttings 
she had 
ever seen 
John are 
you aware 
that this 
is morning 
she said 
in an 
accusing voice 
and so 
suddenly that 
a cry 
of surpriseit 
may have 
been with 
guiltcame from 
and let 
drop his 
trowel and 
wiped his 
forehead Good 
gracious did 
you drop 
from without 
warning cried 
the lady 
in the 
garden hat 
I am 
addressing madam 
said in 
icy tones 
And once 
again ask 
what he 
means by 
being here 
when his 
place should 
be in 
my garden 
I can 
easily explain 
my good 
woman said 
lapsing under 
the madam 
of the 
other into 
the tone 
of voice 
she had 
found effective 
with the 
native servants 
in the 
island of 
when her 
husband had 
been stationed 
there I 
am not 
addressing you 
madam said 
hotly her 
glacial period 
had passed 
and had 
given place 
to the 
volcanicthe suppressed 
volcanic wish 
to be 
informed why 
this manthis 
traitorthisthis Don't 
be a 
greater fool 
than you 
are by 
nature my 
good creature 
said Mrs 
might have 
known that 
you could 
be disagreeable 
over even 
such a 
trifle as 
my sending 
to to 
assist me 
for an 
hour in 
planting out 
the asters 
which were 
only delivered 
this morning 
when they 
should have 
been here 
on had 
not begged 
him to 
come to 
my help 
for a 
couple of 
hours the 
lot would 
have been 
spoiled justice 
to him 
will say 
that he 
was very 
unwilling to 
come And 
what does 
that mean 
pray asked 
sneeringly It 
means that 
he knew 
you better 
than did 
responded He 
has had 
more experience 
of your 
narrowmindedness than 
have had 
Now go 
on with 
your work 
mind her 
But did 
not go 
on with 
his work 
touched his 
forehead with 
the drooping 
aster that 
he held 
rather limply 
saying in 
the direction 
of Miss 
can easy 
make up 
the extra 
however ma'ammortal 
easy in 
the evenin' 
and so 
thought or 
wouldn't be 
here now 
There let 
that satisfy 
you make 
your mind 
easy you'll 
not be 
defrauded of 
the shilling 
for his 
two hours 
said You 
will be 
good enough 
to dictate 
to your 
inferiors if 
such exist 
madam you 
need not 
dictate to 
me may 
keep your 
now that 
you have 
him have 
made other 
arrangements for 
the future 
of my 
garden She 
turned with 
a mock 
courtesy also 
turned Lucy 
go back 
to youryouryour 
henrun she 
cried pointing 
dramatically to 
the place 
of exit 
on with 
your work 
Mrs will 
only be 
too glad 
to take 
on your 
and has 
a gardena 
garden That 
is the 
true and 
circumstantial account 
of how 
and Mercer 
ceased to 
be on 
speaking terms 
and that 
is how 
it is 
that many 
people are 
becoming more 
hopeful of 
the future 
of as 
the centre 
of a 
social neighbourhood 
lady still 
arrogates to 
herself the 
right of 
veto in 
respect of 
the claims 
of any 
strange family 
to be 
visited on 
taking up 
their residence 
within reasonable 
visiting distance 
of but 
the people 
who formerly 
had been 
ready to 
accept the 
dictum of 
the two 
in such 
social matters 
are now 
beginning not 
only to 
assert their 
own independence 
of action 
but even 
to dictate 
to others 
on all 
points on 
which they 
themselves had 
been dictated 
toin no 
mild wayby 
and a 
mistake that 
was recently 
made by 
one of 
these immature 
dictators has 
done much 
to chasten 
their longing 
to take 
up the 
responsibilities attached 
to such 
a position 
had spoken 
with that 
definiteness which 
marks the 
amateur on 
the subject 
of the 
visiting of 
a certain 
who had 
taken Higham 
for a 
year and 
accordingly quite 
a number 
of people 
left cards 
upon her 
suddenly the 
name of 
appeared rather 
prominently in 
the columns 
devoted to 
the proceedings 
in the 
daily papers 
and some 
curious information 
respecting the 
m?nage of 
the was 
brought under 
the notice 
of the 
people of 
and indeed 
of generally 
and those 
who had 
left cards 
upon them 
consulted together 
as to 
whether it 
was possible 
or not 
for them 
to ask 
for their 
cards to 
be returned 
to them 
The general 
opinion that 
prevailed after 
several long 
discussions on 
this question 
was that 
no social 
machinery existed 
by which 
so desirable 
an object 
might be 
effected and 
no move 
was made 
in that 
direction but 
ever afterward 
the dictation 
of the 
feeble amateur 
who thought 
to take 
the social 
reins out 
of the 
hands of 
and when 
it was 
found that 
they were 
pulling them 
in opposite 
directions threatening 
to upset 
the social 
applecart was 
received for 
what it 
was worth 
not for 
what it 
claimed to 
be worth 
IIIFLOWERS The 
instance just 
recorded of 
horticulture playing 
a prominent 
part in 
the breaking 
up of 
friendships is 
by no 
means unique 
one comes 
to think 
of it 
one cannot 
be surprised 
that as 
the earliest 
serious quarrel 
recorded in 
the history 
of the 
world was 
over a 
purely horticultural 
questionnamely whether 
or not 
the qualities 
of beneficent 
nutrition attributed 
to a 
certain fruit 
had been 
accurately analysedthere 
should be 
many differences 
of opinion 
among the 
best of 
friends on 
the same 
subject It 
was my 
old gardenernotthe 
oldest of 
all but 
the second 
oldestwho told 
me how 
it was 
that the 
annual prize 
given by 
the Manor 
people for 
the best 
floral display 
of the 
cottage order 
was very 
nearly withdrawn 
for ever 
owing to 
the bad 
blood that 
was made 
by the 
award no 
matter in 
what direction 
it was 
made seemed 
that the 
prizewinner invariably 
found himself 
compelled to 
accept the 
challenge to 
fight of 
all the 
disappointed aspirants 
to the 
prize and 
before nightfall 
there was 
a general 
distribution of 
black eyes 
and front 
teeth in 
some cases 
both got 
inextricably mixed 
up and 
this was 
no pleasure 
to anybody 
my informant 
assured me 
and the 
wives of 
the men 
who were 
keen to 
compete for 
the prize 
discouraged them 
from it 
with the 
warning that 
if they 
continued to 
spend their 
time over 
the cultivation 
of the 
blooms they 
might some 
day actually 
find themselves 
awarded the 
prize warning 
founded as 
it was 
upon sound 
sense and 
reason was 
beginning to 
produce its 
effects upon 
the better 
class of 
flower growers 
but there 
were still 
a number 
of young 
fellows who 
went into 
training at 
the punch 
ball at 
the clubroom 
the day 
they sowed 
their flower 
seeds and 
so were 
at the 
top of 
their form 
when the 
award was 
made in 
the early 
autumn so 
that if 
one of 
them got 
the prize 
he thought 
if a 
pity that 
his training 
and practice 
at the 
punch ball 
should be 
wasted and 
thus he 
was ready 
to prove 
to all 
disputants that 
the prize 
had gone 
to the 
best man 
while it 
was only 
to be 
expected that 
those who 
had only 
had the 
cold consolation 
of honorary 
mention were 
only too 
ready to 
dispute his 
ability to 
maintain such 
an attitude 
for any 
length of 
time The 
result of 
this joint 
cultivation of 
bulbs and 
biceps was 
not just 
what the 
givers of 
the prize 
intended to 
achieve and 
twice when 
there had 
been arrests 
and summonses 
to petty 
sessions a 
formal warning 
was issued 
to all 
whom it 
might concern 
that if 
the connection 
between the 
two cultures 
were not 
severed the 
prize which 
was only 
meant for 
success in 
the one 
would be 
withdrawn Happily 
however it 
was not 
found necessary 
to enforce 
this ultimatum 
and a 
modus vivendi 
founded upon 
one which 
had been 
understood to 
work very 
satisfactorily in 
the case 
of the 
of Mallingham 
was adopted 
and up 
to the 
present this 
had made 
for peace 
The annual 
of at 
has become 
a thing 
of the 
past and 
the exlightweight 
champion of 
the county 
who rents 
the and 
and to 
whom the 
candidates for 
the prize 
applied for 
advice on 
the biceps 
side of 
the joint 
contest affirms 
with regret 
that are 
becoming degenerate 
It was 
a peaceloving 
florist at 
the honorary 
secretary to 
the who 
explained the 
system upon 
which his 
committee had 
agreed to 
make their 
awards and 
urged its 
adoption by 
the people 
operation was 
not intricate 
fundamental principle 
may best 
be defined 
on the 
analogy of 
the rotation 
of crops 
as the 
rotation of 
awards the 
award of 
the merit 
had nothing 
to do 
with its 
scheme prizes 
were awarded 
strictly in 
turn to 
the professional 
competitorsthe others 
did not 
matter got 
the chrysanthemum 
cup one 
year the 
medal for 
the best 
twelve cut 
lilies the 
salver and 
the vase 
for the 
best display 
of greenhouse 
ferns next 
year it 
was arranged 
that the 
vase should 
go to 
the salver 
to and 
so forth 
the adoption 
of this 
admirable plan 
the judges 
were saved 
a large 
amount of 
trouble and 
there never 
was any 
friction between 
the competitors 
for it 
was understood 
that if 
it was 
year for 
the lily 
medal but 
he had 
a liking 
for any 
other prize 
he could 
nearly always 
negotiate an 
exchange with 
the man 
whose turn 
had come 
for the 
award that 
he fancied 
principle of 
give and 
take live 
and let 
live had 
made the 
one of 
the most 
popular floricultural 
organisations in 
the country 
and its 
adoption by 
the Thurswell 
of the 
prize brought 
about as 
has been 
said an 
entire cessation 
of that 
illfeeling which 
led to 
the use 
of language 
that was 
certainly not 
the language 
of flowers 
and to 
manydiscreditable scenes 
even when 
there were 
no arrests 
made cause 
of peace 
has triumphed 
though some 
people say 
that floriculture 
languishes through 
the lack 
of heal 
thy rivalry 
for when 
every man 
is certain 
of the 
prize when 
his turn 
comes for 
it he 
does not 
trouble about 
the flowers 
may be 
something in 
this suggestion 
Taking one 
consideration with 
another it 
really does 
seem a 
pity that 
the rotation 
system is 
not more 
widely accepted 
by those 
societies which 
have been 
established for 
the encouragement 
of sundry 
excellent objects 
such as 
the breeding 
of bulldogs 
for symbolic 
purposes of 
pugs of 
no use 
to any 
one when 
they are 
bred of 
pigs of 
which the 
prizewinner is 
invariably the 
most uneatable 
and of 
pets in 
various forms 
our neighbourhood 
such organisations 
are to 
be numbered 
by the 
dozen and 
after every 
prize distribution 
the air 
is murmurous 
with the 
complaints of 
disappointed competitors 
was a 
shrewd farmer 
who suggested 
to me 
the principle 
on which 
the awards 
are made 
at our 
local dog 
show reason 
why there's 
so much 
grumbling sir 
is because 
the judges 
look at 
the wrong 
end of 
the leash 
he said 
and understood 
what he 
meant Illustration 
I know 
that the 
impression is 
very general 
that the 
pedigree of 
the exhibitor 
rather than 
that of 
the exhibit 
influences the 
local judges 
But must 
confess that 
could not 
bring myself 
to sympathise 
with one 
of our 
new residents 
who after 
living in 
all his 
life bought 
Harley a 
hp motorcar 
and six 
pairs of 
gaiters and 
set up 
as a 
country gentleman 
must be 
acknowledged that 
at times 
he looked 
a colourable 
imitation of 
one hoped 
that his 
starting of 
the breeding 
of cattle 
and fowl 
would consolidate 
his position 
his researches 
in the 
literature of 
both subjects 
at the 
same time 
resulted in 
some confusion 
course his 
pointing out 
some drabtinted 
cows to 
the steward 
of the 
and alluding 
to them 
definitely as 
Orpingtons was 
a slip 
that any 
one might 
make but 
to hope 
to win 
sympathy for 
a wrong 
done to 
him by 
the judges 
at the 
poultry show 
by affirming 
that his 
bantam cock 
was really 
twice the 
size of 
the one 
to which 
the prize 
had been 
awarded was 
think a 
strategical mistake 
of a 
flagrant character 
Much more 
in the 
spirit of 
the country 
gentleman was 
the remark 
made to 
me by 
a neighbour 
who hunts 
five days 
a week 
in winter 
and talks 
about hunting 
seven days 
a week 
in the 
summer on 
a purely 
literary subject 
He had 
been at 
the in 
the year 
that Merchant 
of was 
being played 
at and 
he confided 
in me 
that he 
thought on 
the whole 
it was 
very fine 
indeed though 
for his 
part he 
enjoyed at 
the more 
fully could 
not quite 
understand the 
point of 
some of 
the jokes 
in The 
of he 
said instance 
he should 
like to 
know what 
there was 
to laugh 
at in 
the chap's 
saying to 
the that 
some one 
had shown 
him a 
turquoise which 
he had 
bought from 
the daughter 
for a 
monkey one 
who knew 
anything about 
precious stones 
knew that 
to pay 
a monkey 
for a 
single turquoise 
even though 
set in 
an carat 
ring was 
to pay 
a fair 
price course 
you couldn't 
get much 
of a 
diamond ring 
for twentyfive 
pounds but 
you could 
get a 
firstrate turquoise 
for half 
the money 
there were 
some people 
he knew 
who would 
laugh at 
any joke 
if they 
were only 
told it 
was in 
a play 
of Shakespeare's 
agreed with 
him and 
laughed That 
was not 
the sort 
of man 
who would 
make a 
fool of 
himself over 
Buff or 
cherish his 
bantams in 
proportion to 
their size 
and weight

IT second 
generation of 
one of 
the shirtsleeves 
families of 
the midlands 
who took

of Castle

name of 
the lessee 
from the 
north and 
with his 
wife and 
family he 
had occupied 
the Castle 
for close 
upon ten 
years was 
a simple 
enough man 
as regards 
his tastes 
he could 
not appreciate 
the beauty 
of the 
cedar wood 
ceiling of 
the banqueting 
hall or 
the carved 
panels of 
the library 
The splendid 
and of 
the made 
no more 
appeal to 
him than 
did the 
in the 
great hall 
or the 
three Fragonards 
of the 
drawingroom was 
quite satisfied 
with the 
reputation of 
having sufficient 
money to 
pay for 
the privilege 
of living 
in the 
midst of 
these masterpieces 
and of 
keeping about 
an acre 
and a 
half of 
roof in 
good repair 
he knew 
more about 
the advantages 
of closefitting 
slates than 
of the 
methods of 
eighteenthcentury artists 
or of 
fifteenthcentury carvers 
His wife 
however valued 
to the 
full the 
artistic privileges 
of living 
in so 
splendid a 
house and 
she was 
not one 
to shrink 
before the 
searching glances 
of the 
wife of 
the first 
baronet of 
the house

painted by 
sacrificing to

assume that

making a 
libation to

as many 
sacrifices as 
on eighteenthcentury 
canvasesto ask 
her what 
right she 
had to 
sit in 
the seats 
of the 
of knew 
what her 
husband paid 
in the 
way of 
rent and 
she felt 
that the 
same was 
large enough 
to avert 
from her 
any indignant 
look that 
a sentimentalist 
might imagine 
on the 
face of 
the most 
malevolent family 
portrait fact 
considered the 
sum large 
enough to 
allow of 
her assuming 
the attitude 
of the 
patroness in 
regard to 
the pictures 
she had 
actually been 
heard by 
a friend 
of the 
to express 
a critical 
opinion respecting 
the pose 
of the 
daughter of 
the second 
baronetthe one 
who became 
well known 
as the 
of picture 
of her 
as Circe 
and to 
suggest that 
the charger 
of Richardshe 
was called 
after his 
father's great 
commanderin the 
picture by 
was scarcely 
large enough 
to make 
a polo 
pony was 
however clearly 
understood that 
these criticisms 
were offered 
by the 
lady only 
by way 
of establishing 
her rights 
over the 
contents of 
the mansion 
so long 
as her 
husband paid 
so handsomely 
as he 
did for 
the privilege 
of such 
an entourage 
had probably 
heard of 
certain rightsofway 
being maintained 
by a 
formal walking 
over the 
ground to 
which they 
referred by 
the claimant 
once a 
year and 
so she 
thought it 
well to 
walk over 
the pictures 
so to 
speak now 
and again 
to show 
that she 
understood the 
rights of 
her position 
really felt 
the greatest 
pride in 
everything and 
in the 
course of 
a few 
years her 
feeling in 
regard to 
them was 
that of 
a conscientious 
descendant from 
illustrious ancestors 
was much 
prouder of 
them than 
the modern 
MajorGeneral in 
was of 
his ancestors 
acquired by 
purchase A 
visit that 
paid to 
the in 
the temporary 
possession of 
the family 
of was 
illuminating went 
not because 
had ever 
met either 
or but 
because was 
acquainted with 
Richards a 
charming old 
lady who 
was the 
sister of 
the unhappy 
baronet and 
had been 
born in 
the and 
lived there 
for twentyfive 
or thirty 
years only 
leaving for 
the dowerhouse 
on the 
death of 
her mother 
Miss was 
on the 
friendliest terms 
with the 
tenants of 
her old 
home and 
could see 
that they 
were pleased 
to welcome 
all the 
friends whom 
she might 
bring with 
her to 
see the 
wonders of 
the it 
was who 
did the 
honours of 
the picture 
gallery when 
we went 
thitherward after 
tea one 
lovely afternoon 
in sum 
mer shortly 
after I 
had come 
to was 
who assumed 
the r?le 
of Cicerone 
and told 
me all 
about the 
pictures and 
gave me 
duodecimo biographies 
of the 
originals with 
all the 
familiarity that 
one would 
expect only 
from a 
member of 
the family 
stood by 
smiling quite 
pleasantly even 
when looked 
at her 
saying something 
about a 
pinkcoated by 
and was 
disposed to 
laugh at 
the comedy 
of of 
telling of 
something confidential 
about her 
greatgranduncle I 
admired the 
picture but 
not nearly 
so much 
as did 
the coolness 
of Mrs 
and the 
kindly toleration 
of And 
this is 
the portrait 
by of 
who afterwards 
married who 
took part 
in the 
and to 
avenge the 
murder of 
poor called 
it murder 
though of 
course some 
people think 
that was 
really a 
spy said 
Higgins it 
seem strange 
to think 
of that 
sweet little 
girl Oh 
pardon me 
cried you 
are not 
quite right 
is Lotitia 
by married 
who was 
killed at 
Oh no 
said the 
tenant you 
are quite 
wrong assure 
you that 
this is 
is the 
girl in 
costume in 
the library 
My dear 
how could 
possibly be 
mistaken over 
such a 
matter said 
dear mother 
told me 
how came 
here one 
day when 
she was 
eightytwo years 
of age 
and how 
pathetic it 
was to 
see her 
stand before 
her own 
picture done 
when a 
girl but 
my mother 
said that 
really some 
of the 
charm of 
the pictureshe 
had lovely 
eyes as 
you can 
seewas apparent 
on the 
face of 
the dear 
old lady 
of eightytwo 
I am 
afraid that 
you are 
mixing this 
picture with 
another said 
Higgins quite 
goodnaturedly And 
then gave 
a laugh 
We had 
better pass 
this picture 
and look 
at one 
which could 
not possibly 
be mixed 
up with 
another she 
said hope 
you will 
agree with 
me in 
believing that 
this is 
Mrs Oh 
yes you 
are quite 
right about 
that one 
said as 
graciously as 
a governess 
commending the 
right answer 
given by 
an errant 
pupil yes 
that is 
believe she 
became pious 
and wrote 
a hymn 
have heard 
that suppose 
I do 
believe did 
replied fact 
have the 
tiny volume 
of hymns 
which she 
wrote was 
under the 
influence of 
Huntingdon But 
clearly took 
very little 
interest in 
and she 
went down 
the gallery 
making mistake 
after mistake 
but Richards 
never attempted 
to correct 
heronly once 
she caught 
my eye 
Mrs had 
attributed the 
of to 
Lely We 
were far 
away from 
the before 
we had 
our laugh 
Wasn't it 
really funny 
said I 
think that 
you must 
be the 
most eventempered 
person in 
the county 
if not 
in all 
said The 
friendly relations 
existing between 
the two 
ladies were 
not at 
all changed 
by the 
persistent patronage 
of the 
picture gallery 
by the 
one who 
was the 
tenant and 
was always 
ready to 
offer a 
hearty welcome 
to any 
of friends 
and to 
do the 
honours of 
the Castle 
did not 
however trespass 
upon her 
hospitality a 
second time 
A year 
or two 
later met 
a curious 
sort of 
gentleman who 
bore the 
same name 
as that 
of a 
family of 
considerable importancecounty 
importance I 
should say 
for outside 
a tenmile 
radius they 
are as 
is usually 
the case 
absolute nonentities 
had heard 
some say 
however that 
the family 
grounds included 
a rather 
wonderful fountain 
which thought 
I should 
like to 
see asked 
the man 
if he 
was any 
relation to 
the family 
and he 
replied brightening 
up wonderfully 
that they 
were his 
cousins I 
believe they 
have a 
nice place 
said there 
a fountain 
that came 
from the 
am greatly 
interested in 
that sort 
of thing 
You must 
mean the 
one with 
the mermaids 
said he 
I dare 
say that 
is the 
one said 
If you 
go in 
for things 
like that 
you should 
certainly see 
it he 
cried me 
see how 
can manage 
it You 
are very 
kind said 
could not 
think of 
bothering you 
in the 
matter dare 
say that 
some day 
shall have 
a chance 
I have 
it he 
cried family 
are going 
away for 
a fortnight 
at Easter 
and when 
they are 
gone could 
easily show 
you over 
the grounds 
I'll just 
make sure 
of the 
day they 
leave so 
that there 
may be 
no mistake 
In spite 
of a 
promise of 
such lavish 
hospitality resisted 
the temptation 
of being 
shown over 
the grounds 
in the 
way that 
was proposed 
the fact 
being that 
had no 
confidence in 
my own 
ability to 
act the 
part of 
the housekeeper's 
nephew or 
the second 
footman's uncle 
who are 
admitted to 
the great 
house when 
the family 
are away 
I trust 
however that 
convinced the 
enterprising cousin 
of the 
great house 
that fully 
appreciated his 
spirited offer 
to allow 
me a 
peep at 
the fountain 
through a 
chink in 
the back 
door as 
it were 
I learned 
subsequently that 
the great 
family started 
in a 
tannery in 
Mallingham a 
hundred and 
twenty years 
ago was 
no wonder 
that any 
one in 
my station 
of life 
could only 
be expected 
to approach 
their demesne 
by a 
back way 
IITHE On 
the subject 
of great 
houses may 
venture to 
say it 
has always 
seemed to 
me to 
show a 
singular lack 
of imagination 
on the 
part of 
some one 
that one 
legend should 
be forced 
to do 
duty for 
so large 
a group 
and this 
legend so 
devoid of 
any stimulating 
quality seems 
to me 
that the 
legends of 
the country 
houses of 
are like 
all divided 
into three 
parts through 
the south 
one is 
shown the 
room in 
the mansion 
in which 
slept is 
scarcely a 
house in 
which that 
particular monarch 
did not 
sleep for 
at least 
one night 
of her 
life and 
so highly 
cherished is 
this family 
tradition that 
I have 
known of 
cases in 
which she 
slept in 
a room 
at least 
sixty years 
before the 
mansion itself 
was built 
around one 
is constantly 
pointed out 
by local 
antiquaries the 
house in 
which Gwyn 
lived certainly 
seemed given 
to flitting 
dozen houses 
at least 
are associated 
with her 
name of 
the we 
are confronted 
with the 
of and 
the legends 
story that 
fails to 
touch upon 
the vague 
history of 
the worthies 
whom have 
ventured to 
name as 
presiding over 
each department 
of tradition 
seems to 
be regarded 
as uninteresting 
monarchs of 
quite as 
blessed memory 
as must 
have slept 
in many 
mansions in 
their time 
yet few 
rooms are 
consecrated to 
the memory 
of their 
slumbers and 
although many 
ladies of 
the were 
quite as 
deserving of 
having their 
memory enshrined 
or ensigned 
in the 
name of 
a fully 
licensed publichouse 
as yet 
none seem 
to be 
regarded as 
so good 
a draw 
as chairs 
of Queen 
of are 
as plentiful 
as the 
mementoes of 
the other 
worthies myself 
have seen 
in a 
mansion an 
cabinet which 
was assured 
had belonged 
to when 
asked for 
evidence on 
this point 
found that 
there was 
none forthcoming 
did not 
get so 
far as 
to make 
such an 
inquiry in 
the case 
of a 
mahogany lookingglass 
offered to 
me by 
a foolish 
dealer south 
of the 
who declared 
that it 
had been 
in the 
possession of 
the same 
unfortunate lady 
was not 
to me 
however that 
another dealer 
tried to 
sell a 
dagger that 
had once 
been worn 
by the 
the proof 
of its 
authenticity being 
displayed in 
the roughly 
cut initials 
evidently the 
work of 
Bonnie himself 
on the 
leather sheath 
Generally speaking 
think it 
may be 
assumed that 
no monarch 
ever slept 
in a 
room that 
was not 
built until 
he had 
been dead 
for a 
hundred years 
Fifty years 
should be 
accepted as 
the minimum 
for such 
an incident 
And the 
probabilities are 
that no 
relic of 
even the 
most easygoing 
sovereign should 
be accepted 
as authentic 
that was 
not made 
within at 
least ten 
years from 
the date 
of his 
or her 
death As 
for the 
legends of 
the member 
of the 
family who 
was known 
as the 
wicked lord 
or there 
is a 
tiresome sameness 
about them 
all and 
most of 
them should 
be treated 
as overworn 
coins and 
called in 
instance there 
is the 
story of 
the dreadfully 
wicked man 
of propertyhis 
portrait is 
usually in 
a panel 
over the 
fireplace in 
the hallwho 
provoked a 
neighbour of 
whom he 
was jealous 
to fight 
a duel 
with him 
after dinner 
one afternoon 
used pistols 
taking aim 
across the 
table that 
bore the 
decanters and 
wineglasses and 
the wicked 
gentleman shot 
his friend 
through the 
heart but 
escaped the 
consequences of 
the fell 
deed by 
inducing his 
companions to 
announce to 
the world 
that the 
man had 
died simply 
of heart 
failure story 
is plausible 
enough if 
you assume 
that the 
coroner and 
the sheriff 
and all 
the other 
authorities were 
threebottle men 
and it 
is easy 
to suppose 
that in 
the early 
eighteenth century 
such high 
officials might 
be so 
described but 
there is 
no necessity 
to wind 
up the 
story by 
showing the 
visitor the 
mark that 
the bullet 
made in 
the linenfold 
wainscoting of 
the diningroom 
see that 
striking evidence 
of the 
scrupulous accuracy 
of the 
story makes 
it essential 
for you 
to believe 
that the 
fatal bullet 
passed through 
the worthy 
gentleman's heart 
and slued 
round his 
backbone before 
lodging in 
the woodwork 
behind him 
and this 
is asking 
too much 
I do 
not suppose 
that there 
is a 
of any 
county in 
England that 
does not 
contain a 
mansion with 
a room 
in which 
this duel 
was fought 
one occasion 
visited a 
lesser country 
house where 
I happened 
to know 
a duel 
had been 
fought in 
the diningroom 
in the 
eighteenth century 
did not 
venture to 
inquire of 
the owner 
if he 
had heard 
of that 
tragic incident 
did not 
believe that 
he had 
but when 
I was 
examining a 
very spurious 
picture attributed 
to after 
admiring a 
dexterous forgery 
of a 
rocky landscape 
by he 
drew my 
attention to 
a portrait 
of a 
blackavised gentleman 
in a 
wig and 
the story 
of the 
historical duel 
came out 
at once 
I must 
show you 
the panel 
in the 
diningroom that 
was splintered 
by the 
bullet said 
my host 
and though 
did not 
insist he 
kept his 
word It 
is said 
he continued 
when was 
looking at 
the imperfect 
woodwork that 
the fellow 
was so 
stricken with 
remorse that 
he would 
never allow 
the panel 
to be 
repaired in 
order that 
he might 
be constantly 
reminded of 
his deed 
and it's 
a tradition 
in our 
family that 
it is 
never to 
be repaired 
so there 
it is 
today I 
did not 
make myself 
objectionable to 
the family 
by assuring 
them that 
they might 
send for 
the carpenter 
any time 
they pleased 
without offending 
the shades 
of their 
ancestors for 
it so 
happened that 
that particular 
duel was 
fought with 
swords and 
not with 
pistols IIIFATE 
In connection 
with family 
traditions and 
family portraits 
there are 
bound to 
be some 
grimly humorous 
episodes with 
the lapse 
of time 
owing to 
the exactions 
of those 
of the 
who have 
held office 
since the 
creation of 
the as 
they are 
called a 
man with 
no ready 
money of 
his own 
inherits an 
estate that 
has not 
paid its 
expenses for 
many years 
and a 
splendid mansion 
containing about 
fifty pictures 
which according 
to the 
most recent 
auctionroom prices 
may be 
worth from 
to at 
picture sales 
think in 
pounds and 
bid in 
guineasthe question 
that at 
once presents 
itself is 
how to 
meet the 
demands of 
fortunate heir 
without a 
penny in 
his pocket 
is called 
on to 
hand over 
from to 
according to 
his relationship 
to the 
late owner 
and he 
wonders how 
he is 
to do 
it some 
cases that 
have come 
under my 
notice the 
only feasible 
way out 
of the 
difficulty has 
been taken 
and some 
of the 
pictures have 
been sold 
in order 
to pay 
for the 
privilege of 
retaining the 
others the 
case of 
some historical 
mansions however 
every picture 
in the 
gallery is 
perfectly well 
known to 
the world 
and the 
heir has 
a good 
many more 
qualms about 
selling any 
of them 
than Charles 
had about 
disposing of 
his collection 
with the 
exception of 
the little 
illlooking fellow 
over the 
settee feelsif 
he is 
capable of 
any feeling 
at allthat 
he is 
selling his 
own flesh 
and blood 
and he 
always wonders 
what people 
will say 
when they 
come to 
visit the 
historical house 
and find 
blank panels 
in which 
for perhaps 
two or 
three hundred 
years stately 
figures of 
men and 
graceful figures 
of women 
had appeared 
What is 
he to 
do in 
such circumstances 
while he 
is thinking 
his thoughts 
on a 
settee in 
the hall 
and the 
of the 
is pulling 
away like 
mad at 
the wroughtiron 
bell handle 
outside and 
telling the 
butler that 
his instructions 
are not 
to leave 
the place 
until his 
bill is 
paid It 
seems that 
there is 
only one 
way by 
which the 
honour of 
the family 
can be 
preserved are 
trusty agents 
who can 
negotiate for 
an immediate 
and a 
secret sale 
of certain 
of the 
pictures are 
taken out 
of their 
frames or 
out of 
their panels 
copies are 
made and 
put where 
the originals 
had been 
for years 
and when 
the latter 
are passed 
on to 
or unsuspecting 
lovers of 
stand beneath 
copies in 
admiration of 
the power 
of the 
That is 
how the 
honour of 
the great 
family remains 
untarnished while 
the of 
the strikes 
a match 
on one 
of the 
stone columns 
of the 
porch lights 
his cigarette 
and goes 
jauntily down 
the avenue 
with a 
large cheque 
in his 
breastpocket All 
very well 
this for 
the time 
being but 
a little 
comedy may 
possibly take 
place some 
years later 
when once 
again have 
to be 
paid and 
probably at 
an increased 
rate per 
cent note 
may have 
been made 
of the 
pictures that 
were sold 
and the 
copies have 
been subjected 
to the 
admiration of 
visitors without 
a misgiving 
are happen 
to know 
copyists of 
and others 
of Gainsborough 
and the 
rest of 
such skill 
in reproducing 
the style 
of their 
particular that 
only the 
cleverest connoisseur 
could say 
after the 
lapse of 
a year 
or two 
which are 
the originals 
and which 
the copies 
then is 
a valuation 
to be 
made when 
the new 
owner enters 
upon his 
inheritance I 
fancy that 
it will 
be discovered 
than were 
suspected of 
it had 
made replicas 
of their 
greatest works

off one

the great

CHAPTER ITHE 
WHEN the 
height of 
his fame 
and engravings 
of his 
and contested 
for prominence 
on the 
flowery flockpapered 
walls of 
many drawingrooms 
with Landseers 
of the 
he went 
to pay 
a visit 
to his 
daughter in 
a southern 
county and 
she has 
placed it 
on record 
that when 
she mentioned 
his name 
to the 
leaders of 
in various 
localities it 
conveyed nothing 
to them 
Why should 
it convey 
anything to 
them did 
nothing but 
paint all 
his life 
in painting 
in music 
in writing 
means nothingin 
many cases 
rather less 
than nothingto 
the society 
of any 
county the 
man had 
brought down 
a couple 
of hunters 
and gone 
out three 
times a 
week to 
hounds the 
people in 
his division 
of the 
county would 
talk to 
you of 
him and 
look on

astonishment if

and the 
wife of 
a retired 
country doctor 
who takes 
up what 
is known 
as workorganising 
village teas 
and village 
concerts and 
at once 
accorded a 
position that 
counts as 
fame in 
such communities 
in But 
if it 
were not 
for observing 
these features 
in country 
life nothing 
of its 
lighter side 
would be 
apparent is 
nothing so 
comical as 
a picture 
in which 
all the 
laws of 
perspective are 
ignored and 
living in 
a country 
town in 
is like 
placing oneself 
in the 
position of 
the man 
in story 
who looking 
out of 
his window 
saw an 
immense and 
hideous monstera 
thing with 
splay feet 
and a 
huge proboscisstalking 
with mighty 
steps across 
a distant 
lawn and 
was greatly 
perturbed until 
he discovered 
that the 
creature was 
only an 
ordinary sort 
of spider 
walking across 
one of 
the strands 
of its 
web which 
was drawn 
across the 
window pane 
Every day 
one may 
have experience 
of people 
living in 
the midst 
of such 
distorted perspectivefancying 
that the 
commonplace insects 
that move 
before them 
are creatures 
of enormous 
proportions and 
importance and 
quite as 
frequently assuming 
that because 
an object 
appears small 
to them 
being far 
away from 
them it 
is quite 
insignificant one 
cannot find 
humour in 
observing the 
attitude of 
people who 
ignore the 
conditions of 
perspective in 
this way 
one must 
be stolid 
indeed A 
typical inhabitant 
complained to 
me very 
bitterly some 
time ago 
of having 
just discharged 
a very 
thankless duty 
in respect 
of a 
stranger who 
at the 
instigation of 
his brothera 
barrister of 
some reputehad 
called upon 
him in 
motoring through 
the county 
admitted that 
the stranger 
was a 
nice enough 
sort of 
man but 
wholly devoid 
of appreciation 
of the 
relative importance 
of the 
persons whose 
houses were 
pointed out 
to him 
from the 
summit of 
the old 
castle which 
the stranger 
had been 
anxious to 
visit I 
showed him 
placeas much 
of it 
as we 
could see 
through the 
treesbut all 
he said 
was is 
continued the 
man pouring 
his complaint 
into my 
ear then 
told him 
that just 
beyond was 
the place 
name was 
all that 
he remarked 
but when 
we were 
leaving the 
castle he 
saw the 
gable of 
house sticking 
out and 
he took 
a fancy 
to that 
tumbledown place 
and asked 
who lived 
there told 
him he 
said suppose' 
said that 
believed his 
name was 
the painter' 
said heard 
he was 
something in 
that line 
you should 
have seen 
his face 
at that 
can ever 
thank you 
sufficiently for 
pointing out 
that house 
to me' 
he cried 
when we 
got down 
to the 
road he 
kept hovering 
about that 
place and 
once he 
said kind 
fate led 
me here 
today yet 
might have 
gone away 
without so 
much as 
glancing at 
the house 
of is 
it any 
wonder that 
almost lost 
my temper 
had pointed 
out to 
the fellow 
and and 
yet don't 
believe he 
ever heard 
of or 
knew that 
had been 
made a 
for the 
county he 
almost became 
maudlin over 
the two 
old cottages 
that knocked 
into one 
painter idea 
of making 
a fuss 
over a 
painter You 
forget that 
the man 
was a 
total stranger 
to our 
neighbourhood said 
must make 
allowances he 
knew no 
better He 
said he 
supposed the 
fellow really 
did know 
no better 
and am 
convinced that 
in his 
own way 
he abused 
his visitor 
to his 
wife for 
the man's 
deplorable lack 
of all 
sense of 
proportion to 
ignore the 
privilege of 
having a 
distant view 
of the 
mansion of 
a deputylieutenant 
of an 
county and 
feasting his 
eyes on 
the cottage 
of a 
painter A 
more amusing 
example still 
of the 
insect being 
taken for 
the mammoth 
was given 
to me 
by the 
person whose 
mammothlike proportions 
intellectually were 
neglected because 
all eyes 
were directed 
upon the 
passage of 
an insignificant 
local insect 
across the 
line of 
vision He 
was a 
literary man 
whose name 
is known 
and respected 
in every 
part of 
the worldnot 
merely in 
that narrow 
republic known 
as the 
world of 
letters was 
staying for 
a week 
at the 
house of 
a friend 
when a 
lady who 
was getting 
up a 
charity concert 
at calling 
at the 
house one 
day and 
being told 
in a 
whisper by 
one of 
the daughters 
of the 
family when 
walking through 
the garden 
that they 
had a 
celebrity with 
them entreated 
him to 
do something 
for the 
entertainment of 
her audience 
she didn't 
mind what 
it might 
be that 
he would 
do if 
he only 
agreed to 
do something 
Now it 
so happened 
that the 
lady had 
a more 
potent qualification 
than persistence 
in making 
an appeal 
to a 
manshe was 
extremely goodlookingand 
the man 
could not 
resist her 
importunity promised 
to tell 
some short 
stories at 
the concert 
and in 
accordance with 
the terms 
of his 
promise he 
turned up 
in the 
schoolhouse where 
the concert 
was to 
take place 
supported by 
his host 
and two 
of the 
family the 
charming lady 
had not 
mentioned the 
fact that 
the entertainment 
was to 
supplement a 
parochial tea 
and when 
they arrived 
this part 
of the 
programme was 
scarcely over 
were no 
printed programmes 
only the 
clergyman who 
presided had 
before him 
a list 
of the 
performers and 
the nature 
of their 
performances and 
he at 
once called 
upon a 
young woman 
who played 
very prettily 
on the 
piano young 
man who 
professionally was 
the assistant 
to the 
baker was 
then called 
upon to 
sing the 
Death of 
which he 
did without 
faltering the 
applause had 
died away 
the clergyman 
rose from 
his chair 
and said 
My dear 
friends we 
have with 
us this 
evening a 
gentleman who 
has very 
kindly consented 
to contribute 
to our 
entertainment is 
a gentleman 
with whose 
name you 
will all 
be familiar 
he not 
present should 
like to 
refer more 
particularly to 
his honourable 
career for 
in his 
presence feel 
that it 
would not 
be good 
taste to 
do so 
and besides 
he is 
so modest 
that know 
he would 
be set 
blushing even 
though were 
only to 
say onehalf 
of all 
that was 
his due 
dear friends 
call upon 
you to 
give a 
hearty welcome 
to who 
has come 
all the 
way from 
to give 
you his 
entertainment familiar 
to you 
all am 
sure under 
the title 
of and 
The amateur 
ventriloquist went 
on the 
platform with 
his horrid 
puppets and 
the young 
people cheered 
him for 
several minutes 
Later in 
the evening 
the clergyman 
without any 
preliminary discourse 
called upon 
the literary 
celebrity to 
tell his 
stories throughout 
the world 
this writer 
is known 
as and 
now for 
the first 
time in 
his life 
he heard 
himself alluded 
to as 
and it 
became clear 
to him 
that the 
good clergyman 
had never 
heard his 
name before 
Happily the 
victim of 
the beautiful 
lady's importunity 
has a 
keen sense 
of humour 
as any 
one who 
goes farther 
than the 
parson did 
and reads 
one of 
his books 
will not 
need to 
be told 
and have 
never heard 
him more 
humorous than 
when he 
refers to 
his selfconsciousness 
while the 
clergyman was 
dealing with 
the fame 
achieved byMr 
the amateur 
ventriloquist who 
had come 
all the 
way miles 
from the 
village of 
where he 
sold bacon 
in the 
daytime do 
not know 
what opinion 
is but 
do know 
that there 
are some 
people who 
believe that 
this sort 
of discipline 
is good 
for one 
whether one 
may be 
a literary 
celebrity or 
some lesser 
personage appearance 
in a 
of usually 
serves the 
same purpose 
but it 
must be 
more than 
irritating to 
a man 
whose name 
is known 
to and 
honoured by 
every member 
of his 
own profession 
to be 
treated in 
the court 
with no 
more consideration 
than is 
extended to 
the merest 
nonentity judge 
professes never 
to have 
heard his 
name mentioned 
before and 
if he 
has been 
a witness 
refers to 
his evidence 
without thinking 
it necessary 
to give 
him the 
ordinary prefix 
of have 
seen six 
of the 
most distinguished 
literary men 
in men 
too as 
well as 
geniusesgive evidence 
in a 
of and 
yet the 
calling out 
of name 
after name 
did not 
cause even 
one of 
the solicitors' 
clerks to 
raise his 
head from 
the paper 
which he 
was reading 
and the 
jurymen chatted 
together without 
being in 
the smallest 
degree impressed 
by the 
prospect of 
hearing the 
great one's 
voice This 
also is 
discipline suppose 
any rate 
it suggests 
that a 
provincial town 
is not 
the only 
place where 
a sense 
of proportion 
is lacking 
CHAPTER IIN 
IF village 
assuredly is 
a typical 
country town 
only inclining 
to the 
picturesque side 
rather than 
the sordid 
most picturesque 
towns it 
is more 
highly appreciated 
by strangers 
than by 
its own 
inhabitants one 
long street 
crawls along 
a ridge 
of the 
and from 
the lower 
level of 
the road 
that skirts 
this ridge 
and meanders 
among fat 
farms and 
luscious meadows 
with an 
old church 
here and 
there embowered 
in immemorial 
elms and 
granges mentioned 
in steep 
lanes of 
old houses 
climb to 
the business 
street is 
really impossible 
to reach 
the town 
without a 
climb of 
some sort 
and this 
fact which 
made the 
site an 
ideal one 
from the 
standpoint of 
the mediaeval 
founders of 
its walls 
and gates 
remnants of 
which may 
yet be 
discovered by 
any one 
searching for 
them in 
a true 
archaeological spirit 
causes a 
good deal 
of grumbling 
among the 
residents on 
both levels 
who have 
to face 
many climbs 
in the 
course of 
an ordinary 
day's work 
motoring strangers 
who pass 
through the 
town by 
the hundred 
every day 
travelling between 
the two 
fashionable coast 
resorts glance 
down the 
narrow lanes 
and say 
How simply 
lovely or 
it remind 
you of 
it does 
remind them 
of have 
known people 
who affected 
to be 
reminded of 
at for 
my part 
only reminds 
me of 
an country 
town the 
convenient centre 
for a 
tenmile area 
of villages 
business is 
done in 
its properly 
called to 
allow of 
two banks 
keeping their 
doors open 
and of 
half a 
dozen shopkeepers 
making modest 
fortunes in 
the course 
of a 
hundred years 
or so 
and retiring 
from their 
halftimbered places 
of business 
to the 
avenue of 
red brick 
villas with 
well fires 
and radiators 
which an 
enterprising developer 
of one 
of the 
manors perceived 
to be 
a longfelt 
want the 
shops go 
on from 
generation to 
generation with 
the old 
names over 
the front 
and in 
many cases 
with the 
family of 
the new 
generation living 
on the 
premises in 
the good 
old way 
in this 
sense however 
may the 
tradesmen be 
said to 
be above 
their business 
there is 
not the 
least disposition 
on the 
part of 
any of 
them to 
appear anything 
beyond what 
they are 
for the 
simple reason 
that they 
do not 
think that 
the world 
holds anything 
better than 
a tradesman 
And indeed 
am not 
sure that 
the world 
holds anything 
less ambitious 
The aspirations 
of most 
of them 
do not 
go beyond 
the acquiring 
of a 
plateglass frontage 
this dream 
literally crystallises 
and when 
the crates 
are known 
to be 
actually awaiting 
delivery at 
the the 
consignee of 
the waybill 
is pointed 
out to 
strangers by 
the simple 
casement shopkeepers 
with bated 
breath and 
an occasional 
break in 
the voice 
is understood 
that the 
plateglass front 
can only 
be achieved 
by a 
limited number 
of traders 
and for 
years it 
was accounted 
a gross 
piece of 
presumption for 
any one 
whose lineage 
as a 
shopkeeper could 
not be 
traced through 
at least 
three generations 
of billheads 
to make 
a move 
in the 
direction of 
a front 
but just 
before last 
a bolt 
from the 
blue fell 
upon the 
astonished town 
for the 
two demure 
old ladies 
who kept 
a small 
millinery shop 
with gloves 
and table 
linen at 
the farther 
end put 
up bills 
on their 
small latticed 
window announcing 
a cheap 
sale in 
consequence of 
impending alterations 
that particular 
shop front 
had remained 
unchanged for 
certainly a 
hundred and 
fifty yearsperhaps 
two hundred 
and fifty 
yearsand the 
two old 
maiden ladies 
who had 
looked after 
it for 
close upon 
half a 
century seemed 
the most 
conservative of 
persons so 
it was 
taken for 
granted that 
the alterations 
which were 
impending had 
reference only 
to the 
affixing of 
a new 
sunblind in 
good time 
for the 
summer or 
perhaps an 
outside lamp 
to make 
the winter 
nights more 
cheerful After 
a considerable 
amount of 
discussion on 
the subject 
an informal 
deputation waited 
upon the 
ladies to 
obtain information 
on a 
matter which 
it was 
understood affected 
the wellbeing 
of the 
whole community 
and which 
was approaching 
a stage 
when a 
specific pronouncement 
one way 
or another 
was absolutely 
necessary Then 
it was 
that the 
truth was 
revealed maiden 
ladies had 
they confessed 
been surreptitiously 
discussing the 
putting in 
of a 
plateglass front 
and they 
had come 
to the 
conclusion that 
as they 
were both 
old and 
life at 
best was 
uncertain they 
should not 
any longer 
procrastinate the 
carrying out 
of a 
scheme which 
the growth 
of the 
town and 
its increasing 
importance fully 
warranted they 
thought It 
took just 
four days 
to fix 
the new 
front in 
its place 
but it 
was the 
topic of 
the town 
for months 
and even 
now you 
will see 
an occasional 
group of 
town people 
discussing the 
innovation and 
wondering what 
things are 
coming to 
The dimensions 
of the 
topic were 
as ascertained 
for my 
own satisfaction 
nine feet 
broad by 
seven feet 
high was 
the premier 
pas led 
to the 
extravagance of 
a sunk 
letter sign 
picked out 
in gold 
an outside 
lamp and 
a spring 
sunblind all 
of the 
most conventional 
pattern and 
all to 
my mind 
in the 
condition of 
the party 
in a 
parlour in 
the parody 
short a 
charming old 
house with 
many features 
of interest 
was transformed 
into a 
foolish hybrid 
thinga single 
sheet of 
plateglass on 
the ground 
floor beneath 
two pairs 
of small 
cottage casements 
with delightful 
stone eaves 
prosperity turns 
out the 
picturesque or 
at least 
relegates it 
to the 
basement and 
so a 
street with 
all the 
charm of 
past centuries 
clinging to 
it is 
fast becoming 
commonplace and 
strangers driving 
through it 
laugh at 
the feeble 
attempts to 
give the 
commercial air 
of to 
a row 
of cottagesabout 
as sensible 
a proceeding 
as it 
would be 
to attempt 
to assimilate 
the fa?ade 
of with 
that of 
in Happily 
there are 
still some 
sixteenthcentury eaves 
left and 
also some 
eighteenthcentury bow 
windowsthe gentle 
curved bow 
of the 
eighteenth century 
not the 
detestable obtuseangle 
things of 
the midnineteenthand 
happily the 
spirit of 
commercial enterprise 
does not 
pervade the 
entire community 
of the 
houses that 
have been 
turned into 
shops contain 
admirable chimneypieces 
and panelled 
rooms with 
an occasional 
fireback and 
basket grate 
seems too 
that there 
must have 
lived in 
the place 
a century 
or so 
ago a 
master workman 
with a 
great fancy 
for decorating 
chimneypieces after 
the style 
of for 
in many 
of the 
rooms of 
sixteenthcentury houses 
may be 
found quite 
good examples 
of the 
early style 
of one 
house there 
is a 
fine parlour 
decorated throughout 
in this 
way IIPRECIOUS 
Some time 
ago a 
mason while 
doing some 
repairs in 
a room 
in a 
very old 
timbered house 
disclosed some 
oak panelling 
which probably 
belonged to 
the sixteenth 
century news 
of the 
discovery went 
abroad and 
a collector 
of antiques 
in the 
neighbourhood bought 
the woodwork 
for a 
hundred poundsfar 
more than 
it was 
worth of 
course but 
that is 
nothing the 
effect of 
the find 
and of 
the sale 
was disastrous 
to the 
occupants of 
other old 
houses for 
they forthwith 
summoned masons 
and carpenters 
and began 
pulling down 
their walls 
feeling sure 
that a 
hundred pounds' 
worth of 
panelling was 
within their 
reach were 
all disappointed 
for several 
years had 
passed before 
the landlord 
of the 
chief hotelit 
had once 
been the 
county town 
house of 
a great 
local familyfound 
behind the 
battens which 
served as 
the stretchers 
of the 
canvas that 
bore some 
very common 
paper in 
his coffeeroom 
a long 
range of 
oak wainscoting 
covered with 
paint usual 
local antiquary 
made his 
appearance and 
through dilating 
upon its 
beauty and 
abusing the 
vandalism that 
had spread 
those coats 
of paint 
upon the 
oak induced 
the landlord 
to give 
the order 
to have 
the panels 
stripped and 
made good 
He little 
knew what 
he had 
let himself 
in for 
carpenters and 
the painters 
attacked the 
room with 
spirit of 
turpentine and 
for weeks 
it remained 
in their 
hands for 
it was 
found that 
at least 
twenty coats 
of paint 
were upon 
the woodwork 
and that 
a great 
portion of 
it was 
only held 
together by 
the paint 
so that 
with the 
removal of 
this binding 
medium the 
panels became 
splinters Before 
the end 
of a 
profitless six 
weeks the 
good landlord 
was wishing 
with all 
his heart 
that that 
relic of 
a bygone 
period had 
been allowed 
to rest 
comfortably buried 
beneath the 
papered canvas 
that had 
entombed it 
all bill 
that he 
had to 
pay for 
the restoration 
was for 
such a 
sum as 
would have 
been sufficient 
to buy 
the same 
quantity of 
absolutely new 
panelling he 
explained to 
some people 
to whom 
he went 
for sympathy 
He laid 
great stress 
upon the 
fact that 
he could 
actually have 
got new 
panelling for 
the price 
of repairing 
the old 
Illustration And 
this was 
the spirit 
in which 
a farseeing 
but nonantiquarian 
lady who 
lived in 
another ancient 
house in 
the same 
street received 
the liberal 
offer of 
a gentleman 
from the 
who had 
taken a 
fancy to 
her oak 
staircase was 
a commonplace 
type and 
might be 
found by 
the dozen 
in any 
old town 
but he 
told her 
that he 
would pay 
her a 
hundred pounds 
for it 
and she 
jumped at 
his offer 
staircase was 
carted away 
and a 
new one 
of serviceable 
deal absolutely 
fresh from 
the carpenter's 
shop was 
put in 
its place 
Her example 
induced a 
relation of 
hersalso a 
maiden approaching 
the venerable 
stageto sell 
the panelling 
of one 
room the 
fireplace of 
another the 
pillared cupboards 
of a 
third and 
actually the 
old black 
and white 
slabs of 
the square 
hall of 
all this 
selling going 
on an 
enthusiast made 
her an 
offer for 
the pillared 
porch of 
the house 
and another 
for the 
leaden cistern 
on the 
roof and 
the copper 
rainwater head 
of all 
a man 
who was 
building a 
house in 
imitation of 
the old 
in the 
neighbourhood set 
covetous eyes 
upon her 
twisted chimneypots 
and some 
peculiar coping 
tiles on 
the roof 
accepted every 
offerwith modifications 
but when 
she had 
fulfilled her 
part of 
the business 
she found 
herself a 
solitary figure 
amid the 
ruin of 
a nice

this juncture

enterprising tradesman 
from who 
was on 
the look 
out for 
branches came 
upon the 
halfdismantled house 
Thinking that 
it was 
about to 
be pulled 
down he 
made inquiries 
about it

he considered 
so satisfactory 
that he 
bought at 
a good 
price all 
that the 
previous speculators 
had left 
of it 
completed their 
work of 
demolition and 
within six 
months had 
erected upon 
the site

business premises

cheapest red 
brick with 
an inconceivable 
broad expanse 
of plateglass

called somebody's 
Cooperative had

Every here 
and there 
between the 
shops in 
the is 
a house 
that has 
survived the 
requestit never 
amounts to 
a demand 
in business 
premises unpretentious 
is the 
appearance of 
all these 
houses but 
the front 
door opens 
upon a 
hall that 
is a 
hall and 
not a 
mere passage 
to a 
narrow staircase 
proportioned rooms 
are to 
be found 
on every 
floor and 
usually a 
door at 
the farther 
end of 
the hall 
admits one 
to a 
garden and 
not a 
mere patch 
of green 
are gardens 
that have 
been cultivated 
for hundreds 
of years 
and so 
artfully designed 
that each 
of them 
has the 
appearance of 
a park 
with lawns 
and terraces 
and pergolas 
not thirty 
feet back 
from the 
street are 
acres of 
orchard with 
mulberry trees 
of the 
original stock 
introduced by 
to make 
possible his 
scheme of 
English silk 
weaving arbutus 
has also 
a home 
in several 
of these 
surprising pleasure 
grounds with 
several other 
rare but 
fully acclimatised 
flowering shrubs 
walks among 
giant lilacs 
and laburnums 
lead to 
banks of 
roses and 
beds of 
lilies and 
hardy borders 
of brilliant 
colour such 
as a 
stranger could 
never fancy 
might be 
found in 
so unpromising 
a region 
The lucky 
residents in 
these wonderful 
houses are 
usually extremely 
exclusiveif they 
were not 
so goodness 
only knows 
what might 
happen When 
a lady 
of good 
family finds 
herself living 
next door 
to a 
grocer and 
an ironmonger 
she is 
bound to 
take steps 
to prevent 
the possibility 
of any 
one fancying 
that she 
belongs to 
that gal?re 
and the 
steps that 
some of 
them take 
with this 
fact in 
their mind 
are sometimes 
very diverting 
usually assume 
the form 
of ignoring 
the existence 
not so 
much of 
the grocer 
and the 
ironmonger as 
of the 
other ladies 
similarly situated 
you call 
upon at 
and after 
praising up 
her garden 
refer to 
the garden 
of at 
will express 
great interest 
saying she 
has often 
heard that 
garden is 
quite charming 
but she 
has never 
seen it 
for herself 
on her 
side may 
go even 
further and 
not merely 
pretend that 
she has 
never heard 
of Wheatley's 
garden but 
also that 
she had 
no idea 
that any 
one named 
Wheatley lived 
in the 
town is 
at first 
but she 
occasionally betrays 
a scrupulous 
anxiety to 
be accurate 
by asking 
did you 
say the 
name was 
yes to 
be sure 
remember hearing 
the other 
day that 
a lived 
at you 
say she 
has a 
nice garden 
And these 
good ladies 
may have 
been living 
within a 
few doors 
of one 
another for 
forty odd 
years and 
the father 
of the 
one may 
have been 
in the 
butter trade 
while the 
father of 
the other 
was in 
eggs The 
social distinctions 
in a 
country town 
such as 
are sometimes 
very pathetic 
might be 
thought that 
the people 
would find 
a bond 
of union 
in that 
illiteracy which 
they enjoy 
in common 
or in 
that profound 
ignorance of 
everything connected 
however distantly 
with art 
or science 
in which 
they live 
from one 
end of 
the year 
to the 
other but 
one does 
not find 
it so

the most 
illinformed town 
in on 
all matters 
pertaining to 
culture whether 
literary or 
artistic stranger 
who was 
unacquainted with 
this fact

was scoring 
a point 
in a 
speech which 
he had 
been called 
on to 
make in 
the absence 
of the

at the 
annual banquet 
of the 
most important 
incident of 
the winter 
in Mallinghamwhen 
he remarked 
that he 
felt that 
the town

the centre 
of the 
greatest literary 
activity for 
motoring through

on one 
of the 
shop signs

farther on

upon an 
great applause

he found 
himself close 
to the 
house of

said these

for themselves

simply because 
of his 
recent achievement 
and no 
one at

had the 
least idea 
what the 
orator was 
referring to 
in bringing 
forward that 
string of 
names might 
surely have 
mentioned who

met anyone

later a 
new curate 
at when 
proposing a 
vote of 
thanks to 
the chairman 
of one 
of his 
social meetings 
with a 
magic lantern 
and an 
amateur ventriloquist

and droll 
by referring 
to what 
said about 
music next 
day one 
of the 
churchwardensa land

how on 
earth he 
could attribute 
such a 
sentiment to

well as 
most people 
and there 
never was 
a man 
in the 
town who 
enjoyed a 
song better 
or knew 
better what 
a good 
song was 
he said 
and when 
the perplexed 
curate recovered 
himself sufficiently 
to be 
able to 
explain that 
there was 
another who 
said things 
besides the 
person of 
the same 
name who 
had once 
enjoyed quite 
a large 
and lucrative 
practice as 
a fully 
qualified veterinary 
surgeon at

shook his 
head much 
as to 
say the 
clergyman added 
in telling 
me the 
storyas much 
as to 
say that 
my excuse 
was far 
from plausible 
but that 
he would 
accept it 
to prevent 
the matter 
going farther

erudition of

four or 
five miles 
away are 
the imposing 
ruins of 
a great 
abbey of 
the had 
once been 
of so 
great importance 
in the 
land that 
when the 
archabbey wrecker 
decreed that 
it should 
be demolished 
he sent 
his most 
trustworthy housebreaker 
to carry 
out his 
orders everybody 
of education 
in can 
tell you 
all that 
is known 
about the 
venerable ruin 
and it 
is the 
pride of 
the town 
that it 
should be 
so closely 
connected with 
the history 
of the 
but have 
never yet 
met with 
any layman 
in the 
neighbourhood who 
was not 
under the 
impression that 
the crime 
of its 
destruction should 
be added 
to the 
pretty long 
account of 
that who 
was called 
and should 
not like 
to be 
the person 
who would 
suggest that 
there was 
another Cromwellone 
who did 
not decapitate 
his king 
but whom 
his king 
decapitated For 
that matter 
however it 
must be 
acknowledged that 
the people 
of Mallingham 
do not 
stand alone 
in mixing 
up those 
iconoclasts have 
found that 
in many 
parts of 
as well 
as every 
deficiency in 
the features 
of a 
church figure 
or a 
church ornament 
is attributed 
to the 
later have

out to 
me by 
clergymen of 
both churches

saints and 
the broken 
carvings caused 
by the 
fury of 
though knew 
perfectly well 
that the 
work of 
sacrilege could 
not have 
been done 
by him 
for two 
reasons the 
first being 
that in 
his devastating 
progress through 
he had 
never approached 
the places 
in question 
and the 
second being 
that the 
sacred buildings 
in which 
the damage 
was done 
had not 
been built 
until long 
after had 
sailed for 
after being 
soundlybeaten at 
Clonmel Of 
course in 
there was 
only one 
curse of 
but in 
soon found 
that there 
were two 
and so 
the progress 
of confusion 
began until 
at the 
present time 
when you 
are visiting 
any old 
church and 
see in 
a niche 
an adult 
saint with 
a broken 
nose or 
a carved 
rood screen

the rood

fluent in 
explaining that 
the heavy 
hand of

be held

which of 
the two

certainly be 
to be 
sureCromwellOliver An

if such 
an expression 
of emotion

of shades 
at the 
accusation being 
directed against 
him instead 
of the 
older would 
probably say 
if speech 
were allowed 
to him 
I have 
the greatest 
possible satisfaction 
in allowing 
my name 
to be 
associated with 
any act 
of iconoclasm 
of the 
nature of 
those acts 
so conscientiously 
perpetrated by 
my distinguished 
countryman He 
would feel 
that could 
he have 
had any 
hand in 
smashing in 
the roofs 
of monasteries 
and despoiling 
rich abbeys 
it would 
be accounted 
to him 
for righteousness 
such splendid 
acts of 
spoliation knocking 
the nose 
off a 
poorly carved 
saint could 
not but 
seem a 
paltry thing 
quite unworthy 
of any 
man with 
a reputation 
for a 
heavy hand 
to maintain 
But for 
all its 
literary and 
historical ignorance 
has its 
heart in 
the right 
place and 
it is 
staunch to 
and to 
the core 
of it 
has its 
procession emblematic 
of these 
principles and 
it must 
be confessed 
that the 
symbolism of

Should any 
question arisefor 
captious inquirers 
may always 
be reckoned 
on in 
these days 
of high 
educational achievementas 
to the 
identity of 
the leading 
typical figure 
in this 
pageant and 
the reason 
of the 
obloquy that 
is heaped 
upon him 
culminating in 
the stake 
with foulmouthed 
explosives the 
answer is 
that he 
is one 
and that 
he is 
paying the 
penalty of 
having failed 
to blow 
up the 
of that 
explanation no 
one can 
doubt that

Of course 
there is 
in as 
in every 
other country 
town a 
first set 
and a 
second setperhaps 
even a 
third but 
that must 
be very 
close indeed 
to the 
unclassed tradesmen 
set which 
is no 
set at 
all here 
it may 
be mentioned 
that the 
tradesmen's families 
are as 
a rule 
very much 
more refined 
and almost 
invariably better 
educated than 
the families 
of the 
first or 
second sets 
years ago 
there was 
an amateur 
performance of 
one of 
delightful plays 
given in 
aid of 
some deserving 
charity performances 
cover as 
does itself 
a multitude 
of sins 
but the 
leading lady 
did not 
need to 
make any 
appeal for 
leniency so 
ably did 
she represent 
the part 
of the 
refined woman 
who was 
not quite 
sure whether 
she loved 
her husband 
or not 
was the 
daughter of 
a professional 
man but 
had never 
succeeded in 
getting into 
the first 
set for 
it must 
be remembered 
that there 
is no 
graduating from 
one set 
to another 
one is 
either accepted 
or rejected 
at once 
couple of 
years later 
however the 
play was 
repeated only 
this time 
it was 
under the 
highest patronage 
so the 
management resolved 
to get 
the real 
thing managed 
to secure 
the services 
of a 
lady of 
title for 
the chief 
part and 
the result 
was appalling 
refinement had 
vanished from 
the part 
so had 
the correct 
pronunciation of 
the language 
so had 
the good 
taste in 
the toilettes 
worn so 
had every 
vestige of 
intelligence place 
of these 
we were 
shown a 
pert young 
person with 
a voice 
like that 
of a 
barmaid in 
a country 
inn and 
a taste 
in dress 
to correspond 
the matter 
of memory 
for the 
words of 
the dialogue 
also the 
advantage was 
certainly on 
the side 
of the 
humbler representative 
of the 
part one 
of James' 
most delightful 
short stories 
the catastrophe 
of Thing 
is depicted 
was not 
more pronounced 
than that 
of the 
second representation 
of the 
comedy Illustration 
It is 
really very 
difficult to 
understand what 
are the 
qualifications for 
the best 
set in 
but somehow 
people usually 
find themselves 
in the 
set that 
suits them 
and very 
seldom do 
the rulers 
of the 
social grades 
in make 
a mistake 
have now 
and again 
sailed very 
close to 
the wind 
however for 
that was 
a nasty 
rub they 
got when 
they hastened 
to call 
upon a 
stranger with 
the title 
of Baroness 
who had 
taken a 
house in 
the new 
part of 
the town 
and kept 
a manservant 
the story 
was told 
me the 
ladies jammed 
one another 
in the 
doorway in 
their anxiety 
to be 
the first 
caller upon 
the or 
la as 
the wife 
of a 
retired civil 
servant called 
her having 
studied the 
idioms of 
the fran?aise 
Madame la 
was indeed 
a lady 
of great 
personal charm 
and she 
was invited 
everywhereeven to 
the villa 
of the 
wife of 
the leading 
brewer which 
represented a 
sort of 
in Mallingham 
competition among 
the most 
select for 
the presence 
of Madame 
at their 
houses was 
strenuous and 
as she 
was in 
such demand 
it really 
should not 
have been 
regarded as 
so surprising 
that a 
magistrate should 
send her 
a peremptory 
invitation by 
the hand 
of two 
detectives to 
come to 
the court 
over which 
he presided 
messengers would 
take no 
denial he 
wanted her 
so badly 
so she 
had perforce 
to throw 
over her 
local engagements 
and grant 
the magistrate 
the favour 
which he 
requested of 
her Her

up against 
one another

porch of 
her villa

haste to 
get back 
the cards 
they had 
left upon 
her VITHE 
That was 
what might 
be termed 
a close 
call upon 
the dignity 
and discrimination 
of the 
leaders of 
in and 
this was 
possibly why 
they held 
back when 
a man 
and his 
wife bearing 
the name 
Stanwell took 
a house 
in the 
town lady 
seemed quite 
nice and 
the man 
was passable 
and before 
they had 
settled down 
it was 
noised abroad 
that they 
had a 
car it 
need scarcely 
be said 
that to 
have a 
car is 
in country 
districts nowadays 
as sure 
a sign 
of respectability 
as driving 
a gig 
was in 
the seemed 
to be 
no reason 
why these 
people should 
not be 
called upon 
by the 
leaders of 
Society but 
the leaders 
were getting 
more cautious 
than ever 
since the 
Baroness' scandal 
and they 
hung back 
none of 
them wishing 
to take 
a step 
which it 
would be 
impossible to 
recall and 
every day 
the question 
of to 
call or 
not to 
call was 
informally discussed 
was just 
at this 
critical moment 
when the 
fate of 
the was 
trembling in 
the balance 
so to 
speak that 
one of 
the leaders 
was visited 
by a 
friend and 
on the 
name being 
mentioned this 
person asked 
Is that 
the author 
must be 
heard that 
he was 
leaving and 
going to 
live in 
the country 
are all 
going Soon 
we shall 
not have 
an author 
left in 
though remember 
the time 
when they 
all lived 
there This 
has a 
car hear 
was the 
feeling suggestion 
made by 
the lady 
So has

photographed in 
it dozens 
of times 
me think 
of coming 
down here 
was the 
exclamation of 
the visitor 
and the 
moment that 
she had 
gone back 
to London 
her hostess 
rushed round 
to her 
partners in 
the government 
of social 
and breathlessly 
announced that 
she had 
discovered that 
was an 
author and 
that was 
his wife 
Good heavens 
was the 
whispered exclamation 
from the 
syndicate would 
have believed 
it we 
were actually 
thinking of 
calling upon 
them they 
look quite 
respectable And 
have a 
car Car 
or no 
car what 
tell you 
is the 
truth he 
not and 
the authors 
name is 
no doubt 
about it 
my friend 
who knows 
everybody in 
said that 
was about 
to live 
in the 
country She 
assumed the 
pose of 
a saviour 
of Society 
and she 
and her 
friends talked 
of how 
providential were 
certain incidents 
let scoffers 
say what 
they might 
for if 
she had 
not by 
the merest 
accidentah a 
providential accidentmentioned 
the name 
of the 
Stanwells no 
one would 
have known 
anything about 
them and 
they might 
have been 
visited quite 
in good 
faith They 
parted feeling 
that was 
very properly 
mindful of 
the best 
interests of 
and so 
it was 
decreed that 
the newcomersthat

had made 
the attempt 
to get 
within the 
citadel of 
exclusiveness not 
storming it 
boldly but 
by the 
insidious device 
of concealing 
the fact 
that at

of them

in spite 
of the 
position which 
he occupies 
he is 
in private 
life as 
sound an 
exponent of 
domestic virtue 
as if 
he were 
an ordinary 
simple citizen 
The eminence 
to which 
he has 
risen never 
makes him 
lose his 
head or 
forget that 
kind hearts 
are more

very little

the proud

for over 
forty years 
and had 
worn the

two consecutive 
terms he 
was still 
just as 
approachable as 
any man

as it 
was said

the majority 
of the 
burgesses and 
now and 
again the 
find themselves 
face to 
face with 
the problem 
of how 
to induce 
any one 
to accept 
the chain 
of office 
Considering all 
that its 
acceptance entails 
upon the 
wearer it 
can easily 
be understood 
that there 
should be 
some reluctance 
to have 
anything to 
do with 
it within 
the ranks 
of the 
eligible it 
were an 
understood thing 
that the 
burgesses of 
the town 
must buy 
their bacon 
and butter 
from the

term of 
office the 
problem of 
the might 
become less 
acuteassuming that 
a bacon 
and butter 
candidate were 
available but 
no suggestion 
of this 
sort has 
ever been 
made so 
far as 
can gather 
and thus 
the difficulty 
is increasing

year with 
the using 
up of 
all the 
available material

The fact 
is that 
a great 
deal too 
much is 
expected from 
the There 
is an 
inaugural banquet 
every year 
at which 
some two 
hundred burgesses 
and several 
of the 
local gentry

bishop a 
rural dean 
and an 
occasional chaplain

expected to 
pay for 
everything and 
as the 
feast is 
founded on 
the noblest 
traditions of 
civic catering 
his bill 
cannot but 
be a 
heavy one 
no way 
is the 
menu inferior 
in interest 
to that

at the

a trifle 
richer than

a little 
sweeter the

To be 
sure the 
banquet is 
artfully meant 
it is 
supposed to 
be by 
way of 
so incapacitating 
the diners 
that they 
are forced 
to listen 
to the 
speeches that

the first

entertainments which 
are supposed 
to come 
from the

many garden 
parties and 
at least 
four large 
receptions with 
refreshments are 
looked for

the transaction 
ends so 
far as 
they are 
concerned feel 
that they 
are honouring 
him by 
accepting his 
hospitality and 
they do 
not consider 
that they 
are under 
the obligation 
to recognise 
him or 
his family

street nor 
do they 
think it

IITHE That 
is the 
attitude of 
these good 
people whose 
names are 
quite unknown 
outside are 
amusing through 
the entire 
lack on 
their part 
of a 
sense of 
comedy I 
am inclined 
to think 
however that 
the attitude 
of a 
son of 
one of 
these in 
respect of 
an incident 
that came 
under my 
notice might 
be more 
definitely described 
had been 
invited by 
a man 
who was 
in a 
far better 
social position 
than himself 
to have 
a day 
with the 
partridges in 
a shooting 
which he 
leased the 
youth accepted 
and on 
the morning 
of the 
day named 
appeared in 
a dogcart 
bringing with 
him a 
friend with 
another gun 
passed the 
man who 
had given 
the invitation 
and who 
was walking 
to the 
first field 
and had 
still a 
mile or 
so to 
go before 
reaching it 
but though 
there was 
a vacant 
seat in 
the dogcart 
he was 
not asked 
to take 
it drove 
gaily on 
and did 
not even 
wait for 
him to 
come up 
with his 
dogs to 
begin operations 
of them 
was walking 
up one 
side of 
the field 
and the 
other was 
walking up 
the parallel 
side lessee 
of the 
shooting on 
arriving found 
himself taking 
rather a 
back place 
the fact 
being that 
he had 
no acquaintance 
with his 
friend's friend 
and his 
friend apparently 
not thinking 
it necessary 
to introduce 
him shoot 
went on 
however and 
save for 
a little 
grumbling at 
the working 
of the 
dogs it 
was successful 
enough getting 
round to 
the dogcart 
after walking 
through the 
last field 
the visitors 
collected the 
birds that 
they had 
shot and 
tucked them 
under the 
back seat 
and mounting 
to the 
front called 
out a 
cheery goodbye 
to the 
man who 
had entertained 
them They 
were about 
to drive 
off but 
the breaking 
strain of 
the other's 
politeness had 
been passed 
I shouldn't 
mind a 
lift from 
you he 
suggested Sorry 
explained the 
one with 
the reins 
but you 
see how 
rough the 
lane is 
and really 
the machine 
is too 
heavy as 
it is 
On minute 
said the 
pedestrian it's 
too heavy 
jolly soon 
remedy that 
and he 
took a 
step to 
the dogcart 
and pulled 
out the 
birds you 
didn't think 
of that 
before it's 
lighter you 
go and 
the next 
time you 
are offered 
a day's 
shooting you 
just inquire 
from some 
one who 
knows how 
you should 
behave will 
in that 
way be 
prevented from 
appearing a 
complete bounder 
For some 
time afterwards 
there was 
a sort 
of coldness 
between that 
man and 
the whose 
representative had 
been prevented 
by him 
from adding 
three brace 
of partridges 
to their 
menu for 
the next 
week For 
a plentiful 
lack of 
good manners 
the representatives 
of the 
best set 
in could 
scarcely be 
surpassed in 
any community 
youth probably 
was quite 
sincere in 
his belief 
that he 
was conferring 
a conspicuous 
favour upon 
the man 
who had 
invited him 
to an 
afternoon among 
the partridges 
could it 
be expected 
that he 
should think 
differently when 
he had 
seen his 
mother and 
sisters feasting 
at the 
Mayoral ball 
one night 
and cutting 
the the 
next day 
when they 
met him 
in the 
street It 
was not

but of 
a much 
more important

so great 
importance as

well known

circles for 
her ample 
appreciation of

exalted position

is gracious 
in proportion 
to such 
dust of 
the earth 
as Mayoresses

she made 
herself so 
pleasant to 
the who 
was entertaining 
her that 
the latter 
determined to 
keep up 
the acquaintance 
so she 
made it 
a point 
to pay 
her a 
visit in 
her private 
capacity drove 
up the 
stately avenue 
to the 
mansion and 
inquired if

interval of

but a 
stranger a 
member of 
the of 
the minor 
Royalty and 
they had 
a chilly 
chat together 
And the 
friendship so 
auspiciously begun 
at the 
opening of 
the municipal 
hospital made 
no advance 
beyond this 
interview though 
it is 
understood that 
the lady

polite as

There is 
nothing that 
the best 
set in 
so resent 
as pretentiousness 
or the 
semblance of 
pretentiousness on 
the part 
of any 
one who 
does not 
belong to 
the best 
set few 
years ago 
a who 
lives in 
a delightful 
old house 
close to 
our village 
of and 
is a 
widow married 
one of 
her two 
pretty and 
accomplished daughters 
to a 
young man 
who was 
beginning to 
make a 
name for 
himself at 
the He 
had been 
at and 
and was 
altogether the 
sort of 
person by 
whose side 
the most 
fastidious young 
woman would 
not shrink 
from meeting 
her enemy 
in the 
wedding was 
made an 
event of 
more than 
usual importance 
for the 
girl and 
her mother 
were greatly 
liked and 
on the 
mother's side 
were connections 
of actual 
county rank 
The list 
of names 
in the 
county newspaper 
of the 
wedding guests 
and of 
the numerous 
presents was 
an imposing 
one among 
the former 
was the 
widow of 
a a 
a retired

of and 
among the 
latter a 
diamond and 
sapphire necklace

of the 
bridegroom a 
cheque from 
the bride's 
uncle a

the supposed

to be 
seen several 
articles to 
which no 
use could 
possibly be 
assigned one 
seemed to 
perceive that 
these must 
have been 
wedding presents 
It was 
however generally 
allowed that 
the wedding 
had been 
a very 
pretty one 
that the 
bride had 
looked her 
best and 
that the 
bridegroom appeared 
a good 
fellow and 
in addition 
to the 
column and 
a half 
devoted to 
the affair 
by a 
generous newspaper 
there appeared 
the usual 
announcement the

the of

assisted by 
the late

This was 
the advertised 
notice in 
the as 
well as 
in the 
local paper 
on the 
day after 
the wedding 
Three or 
four days 
later however

version of

of the 
late Attorney's

of the

piece of 
feline malevolence 
was easily 
traced to 
a lady 
with a 
highly marriageable 
daughter who 
had been 
posing for 
several years 
as one 
of the 
guardians of 
exclusiveness of 
adroit lady 
had only 
to pay 
her a 
visit ostensibly 
to call 
her attention 
to the 
delightful announcementthe 
cleverest thing 
that had 
ever been 
done she 
called itto 
invite a 
return of 
confidence and 
with sparkling 
eyes the 
perpetrator accepted 
the credit 
of thinking 
out the 
scheme for 
the humiliation 
of her 
neighbour for 
her arrogance 
in making 
so much 
of the 
wedding And 
the most 
melancholy part 
of the 
contemptible affair 
was that 
the greater 
number of 
the best 
set actually 
talked over 
it as 
a properly 
administered blow 
to the 
and chuckled 
over it 
for many 
days But 
the very 
next year 
other daughter 
got married 
to the 
heir to 
a baronetcy 
the wedding 
took place 
in Square 
and the 
gave an 
account of 
it to 
the extent 
of half 
a column 
and the 
gave photographs 
of the 
bride and 
bridegroom It 
would scarcely 
be believed 
except by 
some one 
acquainted with 
the best 
society at 
that upon 
this occasion 
the lady 
who had 
displayed her 
skill in 
snubbing the 
sent a 
twoguinea present 
to the 
bride was 
understood that 
the list 
of presents 
would appear 
in the 
but when 
this list 
appeared the 
name of 
the donor 
of this 
special gift 
was absent 
from it 
the twoguinea 
gift had 
been promptly 
returned by 
the mother 
of the 
bride And 
here is 
another touch 
the valuable 
cake basket 
was returned 
with a 
heavy dinge 
in one 
place which 
the jeweller 
affirms was 
not there 
when he 
packed it 
in tissue 
paper and 
shavings in 
its box 
with the 
card bearing 
the inscription 
dear with 
best wishes 
from is 
why he 
refused to 
take it 
back It 
was the 
son of 
this lady 
whose generosity 
was so 
spurned who 
on leaving 
the rather 
secondclass public 
school at 
which he 
received a 
sort of 
education gravely 
said to 
another boy 
from who 
had also 
just been 
finished I 
suppose often 
see you 
at old 
chap as 
we are 
both living 
there and 
sure that 
should be 
very glad 
to have 
a chat 
with you 
now and 
then but 
of course 
you won't 
expect me 
to acknowledge 
you if 
am walking 
with my 
mother or 
sister Why 
not asked 
the other 
boy Oh 
my dear 
fellow can't 
you see 
that it 
would never 
do said 
the first 
know that 
your people 
are not 
in our 
set can't 
expect that 
because we 
happen to 
have been 
three years 
in the 
same house 
we are 
in the 
same social 
position at 
home as 
you know 
there's nothing 
of the 
snob about 
me and 
any time 
that we 
meet in 
one of 
the side 
streets and 
even at 
the unfashionable 
end of 
certainly nod 
to you 
that's the 
farthest that 
can be 
expected to 
go The 
other boy 
certainly expected 
him to 
go very 
much farther 
even than 
the unfashionable 
end of 
the and 
ventured to 
delimitate the 
boundaries of 
the place 
and to 
say a 
word or 
two respecting 
its climate 
and the 
fitness of 
his companions 
and all 
his family 
for a 
permanent residence 
there a 
biggish lad 
and enjoying 
a reputation 
for being 
opposed to 
peace at 
any price 
he could 
express his 
inmost feelings 
without being 
deterred by 
any inconvenient 
reprisals The 
other did 
not even 
respond to 
his exuberance 
upon this 
occasion sulked 
in the 
corner of 
the railway 
carriage where 
the conversation 
took place

a gentleman 
who travelled 
in the 
latest styles 
in soft 
goods who 
was heard 
to affirm 
that was 
not a 
town it 
was a 
dormitory He 
doubtless spoke 
from the 
horizon line 
of soft 
goods having 
in his 
eye certain 
of those 
firms who 
still do 
business in 
the concave 
side of 
ancient bay 
windows and 
have not 
yet been 
lured on 
to fortnightly 
cheap sales 
behind a 
sheet of 
plateglass commercial 
traveller takes 
some time 
to recover 
his selfrespect 
after importuning 
a possible 
client in 
the concavity 
of an 
eighteenthcentury window 
of what 
was once 
a dainty 
parlour but 
is now 
a dingy 
shop Illustration 
But as 
a matter 
of fact 
there is 
a deep 
and pellucid 
well of 
enterprise in 
the centre 
of commercial 
circles in 
and it 
only wants 
an occasional 
stir to 
irrigate the 
dead levels 
of the 
town For 
instance there 
is published 
by a 
stationer in 
the the 
an annual 
work which 
gives a 
large amount 
of interesting 
information valuable 
to many 
persons in 
an agricultural 
district such 
as the 
list of 
fair days 
in all 
the villages 
in the 
county the 
hours of 
the rising 
and setting 
of the 
sun of 
undoubted interest 
to farmers 
the changes 
of the 
moon also 
very important 
to have 
noted down 
to the 
very second 
the equation 
of time 
from day 
to day 
without which 
we could 
hardly get 
on at 
all the 
time of 
high water 
at and 
the variation 
of the 
compass indispensable 
to agriculturists 
graver note 
is however 
sounded in 
the pages 
devoted to 
prophecy after 
the style 
of the 
ever veracious 
Moore where 
readers born 
when was 
in the 
are warned 
against eating 
uncooked horsechestnuts 
on a 
and the 
general public 
are told 
that as 
in a 
certain month 
and are 
in oppositionperhaps 
it should 
be appositionnews 
will be 
published regarding 
the Then 
there are 
pages given 
over wholly 
to poetry 
like and 
his idols 
The spirit 
of enterprise 
which fluttersI 
am afraid 
that referred 
to it 
in an 
earlier paragraph 
in a 
way that 
suggested water 
which really 
does not 
flutteras a 
moth round 
a flame 
round a 
good advertising 
medium in 
is shown 
by the 
pages of 
business cards 
scattered throughout 
the sheets 
of this 
almanac In 
his to 
his which 
prefaces the 
last issue 
the publisher 
who is 
also the 
editor recognises 
in a 
handsome way 
the support 
which he 
has received 
from his 
numerous advertisers 
and expresses 
the earnest 
hope that 
they may 
all individually 
and collectively 
find that 
their business 
will rapidly 
increase as 
a reward 
for their 
enterprise On 
the opposite

be read

Mallingham is 
certainly not 
a dormitory 
so far 
as the 
possibilities of 
trade are 
concerned may 
safely be 
said that 
every business 
house will 
undertake undertaking 
in all 
its branches 
and the 
removal of 
furniture matter 
how small 
may be 
the apparent 
connection between 
the business 
professed on 
the shop 
sign and 
the undertaking 
industry or 
the removal 
industry you 
will find 
on inquiry 
the utmost 
willingness expressed 
to meet 
your wishes 
in either 
direction The 
qualification of 
a dealer 
in antiques 
to carry 
out such 
a contract 
is not 
immediately apparent 
but it 
is certainly 
more apparent 
than that 
of an 
auctioneer at 
least if 
you need 
to be 
buried it 
is not 
to an 
auctioneer you 
will go 
in the 
first instance 
be sure 
if you 
read Othello 
carefully you 
will find 
that there 
is quite 
an intimate 
connection between 
removals and 
undertaking but 
as a 
rule for 
business purposes 
each of 
the two 
trades is 
regarded as 
distinct from 
the other 
But in 
you not 
only find 
them amalgamated 
but both 
are run 
decorously in 
association with 
hardware upholstery 
blindmaking carpetbeating 
life and 
fire assurance 
not at 
all so 
extraordinary this 
last named 
crockery and 
soft goods 
is rumoured 
that the 
largest business 
in the 
lines referred 
to is 
in the 
hands of 
a rag 
and bone 
merchant and 
a dyer 
It is 
pleasant to 
be able 
to record 
that no 
one has 
yet been 
known to 
accept the 
suggestion of 
the pun 
in regard 
to the 
aptitude of 
the dyer 
in such 
a connection 
and it 
is certain 
that himself 
would not 
have been 
able to 
resist the 
temptation has 
said many 
things that 
no one 
in would 
care to 
invent or 
even to 
repeat One 
of the 
most notable 
instances of 
the professional 
enterprise of 
Mallingham was 
told to 
me by 
its victim 
was a 
clergyman and 
the curate 
of one 
of the 
parishes there 
are curates 
who are 
as fully 
qualified to 
discharge the 
duties of 
their calling 
as is 
a or 
even a 
some of 
those whom 
we find 
in the 
country have 
walked the 
hospitals so 
to speak 
having been 
for years 
labouring in 
the slums 
of a 
large town 
but some 
are what 
might be 
termed only 
first aid 
men and 
it was 
a first 
aid curate 
who on 
taking up 
his duties 
in set 
about a 
zealous housetohouse 
visitation being 
determined to 
become personally 
acquainted with 
every member 
of his 
flock He 
had already 
made some 
headway in 
the course 
he had 
mapped out 
for himself 
and was 
becoming greatly 
liked for 
his sociability 
before he 
had reached 
the letter 
in his 
visiting list 
at the 
head of 
which was 
the name 
of the 
dentist a 
gentleman who 
in addition 
to enjoying 
an excellent 
practice as 
a destructive 
rather than 
a constructive 
artist was 
a good 
was between 
the hours 
of twelve 
and one 
that the 
zealous curate 
found it 
convenient to 
call upon 
him and 
he was 
promptly shown 
into the 
waitingroom where 
there was 
an elderly 
lady with 
a slightly 
swollen face 
studying the 
pages of 
a very 
soiled of 
three weeks 
old her 
company he 
was however 
bereft within 
the space 
of a 
few minutes 
and the 
was available 
for his 
entertainment for 
the next 
quarter of 
an hour 
the maid 
returned and 
said that 
would see 
him now 
and he 
followed her 
across the 
passage and 
was shown 
into the 
usual operating 
room of 
the secondclass 
practitioner of 
the country 
town Mr 
greeted him 
warmly and 
so volubly 
as saved 
the clergyman 
the need 
for introducing 
any of 
the professional 
inanities which 
are supposed 
to smooth 
the way 
to an 
honourable rapprochement 
beween a 
pastor and 
an unknown 
member of 
his pastorate 
parson had 
not really 
a word 
to say 
when got 
upon the 
topic of 
teeth and 
warned his 
visitor that 
he must 
be very 
careful in 
his use 
of the 
water until 
he should 
get accustomed 
to it 
had an 
injurious effect 
upon the 
natural enamel 
of the 
teeth of 
the lower 
jaw he 
said I 
will explain 
to you 
what mean 
if you 
will kindly 
sit here 
he added 
pointing to 
the ironframed 
chair the 
shape of 
which expresses 
the most 
excruciating comfort 
to a 
dentist's clientele 
curate wishing 
to be 
all things 
to all 
men though 
he had 
no intention 
of being 
a dentist's 
example smiled 
and seated 
himself an 
instant Ritchie 
had him 
in his 
power bending 
over him 
he gently 
scraped away 
some of 
the enamel 
from one 
of his 
front teeth 
and exhibiting 
a speck 
on the 
end of 
the steel 
scraper explained 
the chemical 
changes which 
an unguarded 
use of 
the chalky 
water of 
the town 
supply would 
have upon 
that substance 
though it 
made no 
difference to 
the secretions 
of the 
glands of 
the upper 
jaw This 
was very 
interesting and 
civil if 
somewhat shoppy 
of Ritchie 
the clergyman 
thought and 
once more 
opened his 
mouth to 
allow of 
the dentist's 
obtaining a 
sample of 
the alkaline 
deposit to 
which he 
had alluded 
the moment 
his jaws 
were apart 
made a 
sound as 
of a 
sudden indrawing 
of his 
breath Ha 
what have 
we here 
he cried 
nasty but 
not too 
far goneno 
sincerely hope 
not too 
far gone 
moment had 
inserted a 
little shieldshaped 
mirror in 
the curate's 
mouth and 
was pressing 
it gently 
against an 
upper tooth 
yes as 
thoughta little 
stuffing will 
save it 
exposed are 
quite right 
to come 
to me 
at once 
stitch in 
time you 
know will 
hardly require 
any drillingonly 
at the 
rough edges 
The clergyman 
was not 
the man 
to protest 
against civilities 
admitted that 
the tooth 
had given 
him some 
trouble the 
previous year 
but he 
had not 
thought it 
worth consulting 
a dentist 
about That's 
the mistake 
that people 
make said 
mournfully They 
usually associate 
a visit 
to their 
dentist with 
some atrocitysome 
moments of 
agonythat was 
the result 
of the 
old tradition 
dating back 
to days 
course in 
those dark 
ages dentists 
did not 
exist whereas 
now think 
would do 
well to 
do a 
little crown 
work between 
the tooth 
am stopping 
and the 
next the 
gap between 
the two 
is certain 
to work 
mischief before 
many months 
are over 
and the 
back of 
the nearest 
molar has 
become so 
worn through 
the pressure 
of that 
overgrown one 
below it 
that if 
not checked 
in time 
it will 
break off 
with you 
some fine 
day glad 
that you 
came to 
me today 
will make 
a new 
man of 
you He 
had the 
little ingenious 
emery drill 
working away 
before the 
clergyman remembered 
that he 
had not 
come to 
pay a 
professional visit 
to the 
dentistthat is 
to say 
he had 
meant that 
his visit 
should be 
a professional 
one so 
far as 
his own 
profession went 
but not 
that it 
should be 
a professional 
one so 
far as 
the profession 
of the 
other man 
went it 
seemed to 
him that 
the dentist 
was fast 
approaching the 
moment when 
he the 
dentist would 
not be 
amenable to 
the convenances 
of the 
parochial visit 
but would 
become completely 
absorbed in 
the nuances 
of dental 
science which 
every revolution 
of the 
emery drill 
seemed to 
be revealing 
could say 
nothing was 
in an 
unaccustomed posture 
for speech 
was lying 
in the 
steely embrace 
of that 
highly nickelised 
chair with 
his face 
looking up 
to the 
ceilingexactly the 
reverse of 
the attitude 
in which 
he felt 
so fluent 
every evening 
With his 
head bending 
over the 
top of 
his pulpit 
he felt 
that he 
was equal 
to explaining 
everything in 
heaven above 
or the 
earth beneath 
but sprawling 
back with 
his eyes 
on the 
ceiling and 
a thing 
whizzing like 
a cockchafer 
in his 
mouth he 
was incapable 
of protest 
even when 
he had 
recovered himself 
sufficiently to 
feel that 
a protest 
might be 
judicious if 
not actually 
effective He 
submitted For 
the next 
four weeks 
he was 
off and 
on in 
the hands 
of It 
seemed as 
he went 
on that 
he had 
not a 
really sound 
tooth in 
his head 
though he 
told me 
almost tearfully 
that previously 
he had 
always prided 
himself on 
his excellent 
teeth I 
think went 
too far 
in the 
end he 
added recapitulating 
the main 
incidents of 
his indictment 
of the 
dentist dare 
say a 
couple of 
my molars 
were showing 
signs of 
wear and 
tear and 
so were 
all the 
better for 
being filled 
in properly 
and it 
is quite 
likely that 
the gulf 
between the 
other two 
was the 
better for 
being bridged 
overpossibly a 
flake or 
two needed 
to be 
ground away 
from one 
of the 
grinders at 
the backbut 
am sure 
that the 
time occupied 
in correcting 
some of 
the other 
irregularities which 
he perceived 
but which 
had never 
caused me 
a moment's 
inconvenience might 
have been 
better spent 
often thought 
so but 
said nothing 
until he 
calmly advised 
me to 
have six 
of my 
upper jaw 
painlessly extracted 
apparently for 
no other 
reason than 
to show 
me how 
the new 
system of 
injecting cocaine 
or something 
worked and 
that he 
could do 
what he 
called work' 
with the 
best dentists 
at thought 
it time 
to speak 
out and 
did speak 
out And 
what did 
you say 
to him 
inquired for 
longed to 
be put 
in touch 
with the 
phraseology of 
a first 
aid parson 
when speaking 
out I 
didn't spare 
him told 
him just 
what thought 
of him 
And what 
did that 
amount to 
grossly offensive 
hope I 
wasn't careful 
of my 
words did 
not weigh 
them they 
sounded offensive 
to him 
cannot help 
it What 
did you 
say to 
him as 
nearly as 
you can 
recollect rather 
a connoisseur 
of language 
and may 
be able 
to relieve 
your mind 
if you 
have any 
uneasiness on 
the subject 
of the 
man's feelings 
when you 
had done 
with him 
did you 
say to 
him I 
told him 
plainly that 
thought he 
had gone 
too far 
and now 
looking at 
the whole 
transaction from 
a purely 
impersonal standpoint 
am not 
disposed to 
withdraw a 
single word 
of what 
said did 
go too 
farI honestly 
believe it 
will understand 
that it 
is not 
easy for 
one to 
take up 
an attitude 
of complete 
detachment in 
considering a 
matter such 
as this 
in all 
its bearings 
but think 
that have 
disciplined myself 
sufficiently to 
be able 
to consider 
it in 
an unprejudiced 
spirit and 
really do 
believe that 
he went 
too far 
If he 
did you 
certainly did 
not said 
he sent 
you in 
his bill 
It is 
not his 
bill that 
mattersit only 
comes to 
s d 
I objected 
to was 
his implication 
that had 
not a 
sound tooth 
in my 
headI that 
have been 
accustomed during 
the past 
five years 
to crack 
nutsnot mere 
filberts mind 
but the 
sort that 
come from 
all the 
school feasts 
without the 
need for 
crackers think 
of it 
Oh yes 
he certainly 
went too 
far I 
agreed with 
him had 
no idea 
that there 
was so 
much enterprise 
in all 
The general 
idea that 
prevails in 
regard to 
is that 
it has 
remained stagnantexcept 
for its 
aspirations after 
plateglassduring the 
past four 
or five 
hundred years 
of its 
existence dog 
of some 
sort lies 
asleep at 
midday under 
almost every 
shop window 
and cats 
of all 
sorts may 
be seen 
crossing the 
at almost 
any hour 
is how 
it comes 
that the 
town seems 
so charming 
to visitors 
and to 
those of 
its inhabitants 
who are 
not engaged 
in business 
This being 
so was 
disposed to 
laugh at 
the sly 
humour of 
a man 
and his 
wifethey were 
nobles who 
motored across 
from to 
lunch with 
us at 
said they 
had enjoyed 
the drive 
exceedingly until 
they had 
come to 
horrid rowdy 
place like 
the of 
on night 
were the 
exact words 
those visitors 
employed and 
had actually 
begun to 
laugh at 
their ironical 
humour when 
saw that 
they were 
meant to 
be in 
earnest some 
time was 
in a 
state of 
perplexity but 
then the 
truth suddenly 
flashed upon 
me it 
was the 
day of 
the of 
the three 
days of 
the year 
when the 
dogs are 
not allowed 
to sleep 
in the 
streets and 
when the 
cats remain 
indoors when 
the is 
for a 
full hour 
after the 
arrival of 
the train 
crowded with 
all that 
it disgorges 
and when 
there is 
a stream 
of vehicles 
carrying to 
the picturesque 
racecourse on 
the the 
usual supporters 
of the 
turf with 
redfaced bookmakers 
and their 
pitches as 
objectionable a 
crew as 
may be 
encountered in 
the streets 
of any 
country town 
at any 
season It 
was clear 
that my 
friends had 
reached the 
of a 
few minutes 
after the 
arrival of 
the train 
and not 
being aware 
of the 
exceptional circumstances 
which had 
galvanised the 
place into 
life for 
a brief 
twenty minutes 
they had 
assumed that 
this was 
the normal 
aspect of 
the town 
did my 
best to 
remove from 
the reproach 
of being 
the great 
centre of 
bustling life 
that it 
had seemed 
to these 
strangers but 
could see 
that did 
not altogether 
succeed in 
convincing them 
that except 
for four 
days out 
of the 
year nothing 
happens in 
days of 
races and 
one night 
of loyal 
revelryfor even 
the holding 
of the 
three times 
a year 
does not 
cause the 
town to 
awake from 
its immemorial 
repose trumpets 
sound as 
the judge 
drives up 
to the 
with a 
mounted escort 
and the 
shopkeepers come 
to their 
doors and 
glance down 
the street 
the sleeping 
dogs jump 
up and 
begin to 
bark in 
a halfhearted 
way but 
settle themselves 
comfortably down 
again before 
the last 
note of 
the fanfare 
has passed 
away and 
except for 
an occasional 
glimpse of 
a man 
in a 
wig crossing 
the street 
to the 
hotel the 
week passes 
much the 
same as 
any other 
week of 
the uneventful 
year hundred 
years have 
passed since 
anything happened 
in and 
then it 
was nothing 
worth talking 
about must 
go back 
seven hundred 
years to 
find the 
town the 
centre of 
an historical 
incident of 
importance But 
the rumour 
is that 
drapers and 
outfitters are 
about to 
have a 
new plateglass 
front made 
for both 
their shops 
with convex 
corners and 
rollup shutters 
so marches 
onward from 
century to 
centuryslowly
